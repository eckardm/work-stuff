PRESIDENT'S REPORT.
To the Regents of the University:
I beg to present to you my Annual Report for the year
ending September 30, I906.
We have met with heavy afflictions in the death of three
of the members of the Literary Faculty.
On March I, Paul Rousseau Bellon dePont, A. B.,
B. S., Assistant Professor of French and Registrar of the
Literary Department, died suddenly of angina pectoris. He
had been in service since I87I. Of a distinguished French
family, educated in the College de Juilly and the College
Rollin, his fine breeding, his excellent taste in literature
and in music, and his genial temperament greatly endeared
him to his colleagues and to the students, with many of
whom   his duties as Registrar brought him into close
relations.
Albert Henderson Pattengill, A. M., Professor of
Greek, died on March I6 of heart disease. He had been
connected with our Greek department since I869. He was.

a teacher of unusual power over his students. They not
only learned from him Greek, but learned also how to study.
He was exacting in his requirements and many of our graduates testify that under his guidance they gained the habit
and learned the value of strenuous self-discipline in scholarly work. As a member of the Athletic Board of Control
from its organization, and for a large part of the time its
chairman, he rendered most valuable service to the University.
On May I, Isaac Cook Russell, C. E., LL. D., Professor
of Geology since 1892, died after a brief illness of pneumonia. He had a wide and honorable reputation as a
geologist both in this country and in Europe. He had
done much useful work in the service of the Michigan
geological survey and in that of the United States survey.
He had also written several books, which are highly
esteemed. He was a student and a writer of indefatigable
industry and a most interesting lecturer.
The attendance inclusive of that of the Summer School
(in the summer of 1905) was 4,57I, exclusive of that 4,293.
In our Calendar for the year preceding the corresponding
figures were 4,136 and 3,832. In the regular session there
was a gain in the Literary Department of I49, in the Engineering Department of 172, in the Law Department of 25.
Rapid as is the general increase in numbers, the increase
in the attendance of Michigan students is still more rapid.
Last year they formed 57 per cent, this year 59 per cent, of
the whole. But.the large attendance from other states,
which are provided with excellent colleges, remains noteworthy and gratifying, e. g., Ohio 399, Illinois 335, New
York 262, Pennsylvania I97, Indiana I8I, Iowa 93, Missouri
73, New  England 62.    All of our Territories, except
Alaska, our insular possessions, 43 states and I6 foreign
states and provinces, were represented in our body of
students.
The increase in attendance last year over that of the
preceding year was between 400 and 500, a number equal or
superior to the entire attendance in many an American
college of good repute. And no reason is now apparent
why a rate of increase approaching this or equal to it may
not continue for some years. It is a noteworthy fact that

an increase almost as rapid is experienced by several of the
larger universities of the west, while the attendance of the
more important universities in the east shows no such rate
of increase; indeed in some of them there has been a decline.
The reasons for the phenomenon in the west seem to be
three: first, the number of good high schools which prepare
students for college is multiplying at a rapid rate; second,
the prosperity of the west in recent years has been such
that a much larger proportion of parents can send their
children to college; and third, the passion for education is
constantly growing stronger in the west, and with it the
conviction which was formerly not held by some influential
persons that a thorough training in a college or technical
school is an excellent preparation for a career in business
or in engineering. It seems clear, therefore, that this
University, like other western universities, is called in
making its plans for the future to provide for the instruction of large numbers of students. The State is confronted
with the problem of maintaining a great school for all the
years to come but we who are charged with the immediate
management of the school have before us the problem, by
no means a simple one, of devising the best means of
instructing such a great and ever increasing company of
students. It behooves the State to take large and generous
views of the obligations it has assumed in founding the
University, and it behooves the Regents and the Faculties
to consider. carefully how they can so conduct the great
trust committed to them by the State as to make it productive of the best results.
The following figures show the attendance of women
for last year and for this year (exclusive of the Summer
School, in which the number was exactly the same in both
years, III.)
1904-5 1905-6
Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts...... 646  680
Department of Medicine and Surgery................ 30  25
Department of Law...                           I    2
School of Pharmacy...                           2     I
Homceopathic Medical College....................... 13  9
College of Dental Surgery...........................  2  3
694   720

OCTOBER MEETING, 90o6.


The attendance in I902-3 was 714, in I903-4, 716. These
figures tend to confirm the conclusion given in my last
report that the number of women for some time to come is
likely to be about 700.
I regret to say that we lose from our teaching staff
Andrew C. McLaughlin, Professor of American History,
who becomes Professor of History in Chicago University,
and George Hempl, Professor of General Philology and
General Linguistics, who has accepted the Professorship of
German in the Leland Stanford University. These professors are drawn from us by the strong inducements of
higher salaries and of such organization of their departments as leave them  larger opportunities for study and
research than they have enjoyed here. We have been
before reminded that we are exposed to the danger of losing
some of our more eminent teachers on similar grounds, and
the question is forced upon us whether we can find the
means to fix a scale of salaries which shall protect us against
the desire of our stronger universities to call into their
service some of our most eminent teachers.   With the
rapidly increasing cost of living the necessity of raising the
salaries of competent college and university professors is
gaining recognition all over the country. We cannot, if
we would, isolate ourselves from the general competition
for securing the best men, unless we are willing, as we
cannot be, to. content' ourselves with a staff inferior in merit
to other universities. It may not be necessary to fix a scale
of compensation as high as that in some university towns,
where the expense of living in a decent and becoming
manner is necessarily higher than it is here, but our scale
must bear a more just proportion to it than it now does, if
we are permanently to retain our ablest men. This is an
unwelcome statement to make in view of the present condition of our treasury, but nothing can be gained by
blinding our eyes to the plain facts in the case.  It is
proper that the State, as well as ourselves, should know
them.
The vacancies caused by deaths and by resignations we
have filled as follows:
Andre Beziat de Bordes, who has before served us very
acceptably, is. appointed Assistant Professor of- French in
the place of Professor dePont.




OCTOBER MEETING, I906.                 5
Henry Fairbanks, Ph. D., succeeds to the Chair of
Greek, held by Professor Pattengill.  Dr. Fairbanks, a
graduate of Dartmouth, Yale and Leipsig, has been a member of the Faculties of Cornell University and the Iowa
State University, and has won a recognized position among
the classical scholars of America by his writings.
The Chair of Geology, vacated by the death of Professor Russell, is temporarily filled by Professor William
H. Hobbs, Ph. D., a graduate of the Worcester Polytechnic
Institute and of the Johns Hopkins University, and a student at the University of Heidelberg. He has been connected with the United States Geological Survey and has
'been a member of the Faculty of the University of Wisconsin, and has an excellent scientific reputation both here
and. abroad.
Assistant Professor Van Tyne is promoted to the Professorship of American History. His success as a teacher
and the reputation he has made by his valuable work in
American History are a sufficient guaranty of his fitness
for his new position.
Frederic L. Paxson, Ph. D., a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, succeeds Mr. Van Tyne as Assistant Professor. He has produced sterling contributions to
American History. He has filled with success the Chair
of American History in the University of Colorado.
A portion of Professor Hempl's work is distributed
among other Professors. The work in Anglo-Saxon, Old
English and Middle English is committed to Dr. Tilley, a
graduate of the University of Virginia, who pursued special
studies abroad, and has held a place in the Faculty of the
Syracuse University.
The force in the department of the Science and the Art
of Teaching has been increased by the appointment of
Irving King, Ph. D., as Assistant Professor and Examiner
of Schools. The work falling upon that department is
rapidly growing more heavy and important.
Some have feared that the strong desire of young men
to get to their professional studies, and the very marked
trend in recent years of the graduates of our high schools
towards engineering studies would reduce the attendance
in'the Literary Department. It is therefore gratifying to




6


OCTOBER MEETING, 1906.


observe that there was a gain in that department this year
of I49 students. Our professional schools are so strong
and so conspicuous that we who are custodians of the
University need always to bear in mind that the Literary
Department should be cherished and nurtured as the source
of the central life and power of the Institution. The Faculties of our professional schools, including the Engineering
Department, would be glad if every one of their students
would take the whole or a considerable part of the work
required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts before coming under their care. At present it does not seem practicable to require this. But there would be a weakening of
the University in every fibre, if the Literary Department
should ever be allowed to decline in the vigor or richness of
the training which it gives. The ablest and most inspiring
teachers must be found for it, even if this calls for salaries
as generous as those required to, draw men from the professions to the chairs in our professional schools. We may
well consider whether our policy on this point does not
need some revision.
The Engineering Department has been busily engaged
in revising its course of study and getting fairly settled in
its new building. It has been somewhat embarrassed by
its crowded classes. The Work laid out makes most strenuous demands upon the students, and calls for one period
of six weeks in the summer vacation. That makes an
important addition to the cost of instruction and is objected
to by some parents.  The work of training a modern
engineer is so heavy and so varied that if the principal
schools will agree to adopt the plan of a five years' course,
that will probably be expedient.  The demand for well
trained and capable graduates continues and shows no
signs of abating.. We are now graduating marine engineers,
who readily find positions in our ship-yards.
We are now to resume instruction in Architecture under
Professor Emil Lorch. It was carried on from 1876 to
I88. under Professor Jenney, and some men were graduated who have attained eminence in their profession. The
work was provided for by a special appropriation of the
Legislature at the urgent suggestion of Governor Bagley.
But in 1877 the Legislature failed to renew the appropria



OCTOBER MEETING, 1906.

tion, and so the instruction was necessarily and much to our
regret discontinued. We trust that we shall now be able
to maintain it permanently.
Notwithstanding the general decline in attendance in
medical schools, our Department of Medicine and Surgery
substantially held its ground this year.  The increasing
demands which State Legislatures and State Medical
Boards are making on students for admission to practice
are hastening the extinction of the weaker schools. After a
good proportion of these have been eliminated, the stronger
schools will probably regain their former numbers. In no
department of education has greater progress been made in
the last few years than in that of medicine. But if the best
standard of instruction is maintained, perhaps no department of education except engineering is so costly. And it
is quite impossible for the old fashioned "country schools,"
as they were called, to meet the necessary expense, and to
provide the long course of instruction now required. Medical education is therefore likely to be concentrated in the
larger and thoroughly equipped schools.
Our Law Department continues to maintain its lead of
all the Law Schools in the country in point of attendance.
Indeed the numbers are almost embarrassing.   But by
strenuous and exacting demands on the students, the
standard of work is held up to a high level. An increasing
number of the literary students take the combined literary
and law course.
The Homceopathic College and the School of Pharmacy
both register a small gain in attendance.  The figures
remain so steady that we may perhaps conclude that the
demand which they are meeting is about the normal
one.
The Dental Department appears to, have overcome the
shrinkage due to,the change made a few years ago by the
lengthening of the course, now that the three years' course
has been restored. We are very glad to announce that the
desire which we have cherished for some years to bring to
the Faculty Dr. W. D. Miller, Professor in the University
of Berlin, is to be met. He will come to the School as Dean
a year hence. Dr. Miller graduated here, A. B. in I875.
He has made a world-wide reputation for his researches in




8


OCTOBER MEETING, 1906.


the bacteriology of the oral cavity. As a scientific investigator he will add great strength to our Faculty.
It will be remembered that the Legislature on its own
initiative, not at our request, made an appropriation for the
erection and maintenance of a Psychopathic Ward adjacent
to the University Hospital, in which persons suffering from
peculiar affections of the nervous system or in the incipient
stages of insanity could receive special treatment and in
which their ailments could be made the subject of special
study. This work was to be done in close and friendly
relations with the State Asylums for the Insane. When the
ward was opened a number of patients were sent to it from
the Asylums. I am informed that the Asylum Board and
Superintendents are pleased with the results of the experiment and we are confident that this wise ministration to the
comfort and relief of the class of patients for. whom this
Ward is reserved will continue to receive the needed support by the State. I need hardly add that our Medical Professors are more than willing to render gratuitously such
assistance as they can in the care of these patients.
During the past year the condition of the Observatory
has been very materially improved. The residence for the
Director has been enlarged and remodeled; the west wing
of the main building has been converted into a single large
room for the accommodation of the Observatory Library
and for use as a study and.seminary room; the computing
room and the quarters for students have been renovated;
the basement under the computing room and students'
quarters has been converted into an instrument shop, supplied with an excellent equipment of machine and bench
tools, especially suited to the repair and construction of
instruments. An instrument maker, Mr. E. J. Madden, has
been employed since January in fitting up the shop, in overhauling, repairing, and making additions to such of the
present instruments as require it, to put them in condition to
meet the requirements of modern practice in astronomy.
To enable the Observatory to extend its activities, the
Board of Regents at their June meeting made an appropriation toward the construction of a large reflecting telescope for photographic and spectroscopic work. The order
for the optical parts of this instrument, which is to have a




OCTOBER MEETING, 1906.                     9
clear aperture of thirty-six inches, has been placed with the
firm of Messrs. John A. Brashear Company, Allegheny, Pa.
They have ordered the glass required from makers in Paris.
The plans for mounting this instrument are now     under
consideration.
The Summer School is growing in numbers and in
importance. The following figures give the attendance in
the summer of 19o5 and of I906:
1905  I9o6
Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts........ 514  560
Department of Medicine and Surgery.................. 74  96
Department of Law...................0................  3  133
69I   789
Engineers required to take a summer course in addition
to their regular work............................. 125  245
Total number under instruction................ 86  1034
The number of women each year was III
It is interesting and encouraging to note that in the
session of I906 there was an attendance of 54 graduate
students.  Of these 13 are candidates for the degree of
Ph. D., 32 for the degree of A. M., and 9 are not candidates
for a degree. Of these 54, the men numbered 34, and the
women 20. Forty are graduates of this University and fourteen of other colleges.
Omitting consideration of the Laboratory fees, which
are largely payment for materials furnished, the expense of
the Summer School is about $3,000. But it is doubtful if
any equal expenditure is more helpful to the State or to the
University. The teachers, who form so large a proportion
of the students, return to their schools prepared to teach
with new efficiency and also filled with fresh interest in the
work of the University. It is a wise policy to strengthen
the school so far as our means will allow.
The Appointment Committee has come to be an important part of our organization. It aims to supply the demand
for teachers in our high schools and in colleges by a discriminating choice of our students and graduates. It takes great
pains "to put the right person in the right place." It has




10           OCTOBER MEETING, 1906.
assisted during the year in placing no less than two hundred
persons. So judiciously is it doing this work, in spite of
the fact that it cannot avoid some mistakes, that school
boards now very largely trust implicitly to its judgment,
and accept, without much question, the persons the Committee recommends. The Committee is thus rendering much
valuable service to the schools as well as to our students.
The members of that Committee deserve great credit for the
care and skill with which they have performed their delicate and difficult duty.
The Libraries of the University have been increased
during the year by the following accessions:
General  Library..................................... 9044  Vols.
Medical Library.....................................  335 "
Homceopathic  Library................          201  "
D ental  Library........................................  46 "
Shakespeare Collection............................... 252 
Goethe  Collection............     "
Law Library                                      999  "
Total............................................. 896
Of the accessions to the General Library 3,233 volumes
were gifts and 758 were received in exchange. Of the
accessions to the Medical Library 505 volumes were gifts
and 76 were received in exchange. There were also 25
gifts to the Homceopathic Collection and 66 gifts to the
Law Library. Counting the exchanges as gifts, the latter
amount to 4,663 volumes, or two-fifths of the entire number of accessions.
In February last we found it practicable to accomplish
what we had long desired, namely, a plan for allowing
students to draw books from the General Library for use
in their rooms. We have so many readers that this policy
could not well be adopted until the present number of volumes had been accumulated. The students highly appreciate the privilege thus granted.
The statistics of the circulation department show that
in the second semester I,046 students availed themselves of
the privilege and of the 4,636 (to June 2I) books taken out

for home.use (exclusive of the over night circulation) fifty
per cent belonged to English literature. The figures show
the following authors to have been the most frequently borrowed: Shakespeare, Hardy, Stevenson, Dickens, Kipling,
George Eliot, Jane Austin, Hawthorne, and Thackeray. Of
the remaining fifty per cent the circulation was divided as
follows, by per cent: Philosophy and Religion, 53/; Sociology and Economics, 5; Education, 2; Science, 4; Medicine,
4; Fine Arts and Music, I; German Literature, 5!; Romance
Languages, 825; Latin and Greek, 3; History, 12.
We have again to thank our benefactors, Hon. Dexter
M. Ferry, Parke, Davis & Co., Frederick Stearns & Co.,
Theodore D. Buhl, Hon. Peter White, Mrs. Helen H. Newberry, and Mrs. George S. Morris for the continuance of
Fellowships.
We are also under obligation to Hon. A. M. Todd, of
Kalamazoo, for offering five prizes of one hundred dollars
each to our students for essays on subjects of great importance, and also for a valuable collection of Egyptian
antiquities.
We owe our thanks to an anonymous donor of important
additions to our De Criscio Collection of Classical
Archaeology.
Mr. Nathan M. Kaufman, of Marquette, has established
a testimonial of $I50 to be given to the honor men in the
oratorical contest.
We are under special obligations to Dr. Walter H.
Nichols, B. S., I89I, and his wife, Esther B. Connor Nichols, B. S., 1894, for the gift of some thirty acres of land in
the eastern part of the city for a botanical garden. The
intention is to use it for the growth of the trees and plants
native to this region so that students may readily have
access to them. This garden is adjacent to a tract of
twenty-three acres which the city has purchased for a park.
It is contemplated that there shall be no fence between them,
but that they shall be open in common to the public. Both
the citizens and the students will appreciate the opening of
these spacious 'and attractive grounds.
In my last Report I discussed at some length the condition of college athletics and the reasonable and unreasonable




12


OCTOBER MEETING, 1906.


criticisms upon the players and upon the college authorities.  I closed by saying "indisputably then something
remains to be done to rid college athletics of certain objectionable practices, and college faculties who have already
done so much to abolish abuses are not likely to neglect
their duty in the future. They all desire to secure the general participation of students in some form of outdoor
activity."
In harmony with these ideas the nine Western Universities whose students have been accustomed to meet in intercollegiate athletic contests, especially in. football, sent delegates from their faculties to two conferences during the
year to consider what new rules, if any, they should agree
on for the better regulation of football contests. It was
found that they were nearly all of one mind in condemnation
of certain usages which had grown up. They were of the
opinion that there were too many great games in each
season, that too much time and too much money were
devoted to the games, that Freshmen ought not to be
allowed on the university teams, that the employment of
coaches brought in from outside the Institution, and especially at extravagant salaries should be dispensed with, that
the price of tickets of admission to the games should be so
reduced that all the students could afford to attend, and
that 'the offering of pecuniary inducements to school boys
or to others to come to college in order to play on the team
should be condemned and forbidden.
The Conference adopted a set of rules, embodying these
ideas, and calculated to carry them into effect, and these
rules were adopted   by the faculties of the several
universities.
Meantime many other colleges and universities, mainly
those in the east, held conferences with a view to modify the
rules of playing, in order to make it less open to the charge
of violence and brutality which had been made. After
long deliberation, they came to an agreement and the western universities accepted their decision on that point.
The autumn games now come on under these changed
conditions. It remains to be seen what the results will be.
Certain it is, that the faculties have in good faith endeav



OCTOBER MEETING, 90o6.


18


ored to make some reforms. I believe that it will prove
that their efforts have not been in vain. Certain it is that
football will continue to be played, and will attract many
spectators 'and will probably excite more interest among
students than any other athletic game.
I am happy to say that during the year we have been able
to make the needed addition to the Phyisical Laboratory.
The Department of Physics is now fairly well provided.
But our funds did not suffice for the erection of the
other buildings, of which we are in such pressing need.
We trust that in some way we may receive from the State
the means for constructing some of the buildings so
urgently called for. The reconstruction of the old Medical
Building which has been condemned by expert engineers
as unsafe, the erection of a new Dental building, the
enlargement of the Library building, and the construction
at no distant day of a new and more spacious Chemical
Laboratory I spoke of in my Report a year ago. We could
properly without any extravagance expend half a million
dollars on new buildings of the simplest architecture. Our
work will be seriously hampered, if we cannot soon be provided with some of them. The Alumni Association have
not yet begun the construction of the Memorial Building,
for which they have subscribed the funds, because they have
not yet decided how large a structure it will be wise for
them to erect. The answer to that question depends on how
large a sum will finally be available.
We have every reason to suppose that the citizens of
Michigan are satisfied that we are making a prudent and
effective use of the means they have placed at our disposal
for the support of the University. We trust that they will
see that with the continued and rapid growth of the Institution and with the improvement which we in common with
the other great universities are constantly striving to make
in our instruction the expense of maintenance must, in spite
of our practice of the utmost economy, necessarily increase.
Some of our sister States in the west are devoting larger
sums than we to the support of their universities, although
the number of their students is considerably less than the
number of our students.

In the budget of I904 you granted me an assistant at $200 to
aid me in handling the theses of the senior class in courses II,, 12,
and 14. Up to this time I have succeeded in finding among the graduate students persons competent for this work; but this year no quite
satisfactory person has appeared. I would ask, therefore, that for
the present year I be allowed to expend not to exceed the above
amount under the direction of the Auditing Board in employing Mr.
T. E. Rankin, Instructor in Rhetoric, to aid me in this work. He is
thoroughly equipped for the somewhat difficult task, and is willing
to lay aside temporarily some graduate work he is doing in order
to assist me. Another year I hope to be able to return to the original arrangement.         Respectfully submitted,
ISAAC N. DEMMON.
On motion of Regent Barbour, and at the request of Dr.
Herdman, Professor David Inglis of Detroit was 'appointed

recommendation of the classical staff was approved, and the
President was requested to transmit the cordial thanks of
the Board to Mr. Buhl:
ANN ABROR, Oct. 24, I906.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan.
Gentlemen-I have pleasure in reporting that Mr. Theodore D.
Buhl, of Detroit, has contributed the sum of $500 for the renewal

Very respectfully,

Effie MacLeming,
Laura May Helmer,
Florence Edna Parrott.
On motion of Regent Hill, the degree of Bachelor of
Laws was conferred upon Daniel Carl Murphy and Elmer
Harry Phelps, in accordance with the recommendation of
the Law Faculty.
Regent Barbour presented the following communication
from the Dean of the Department of Medicine and Surgery
and the recommendations therein contained were approved
by the full vote of the Board:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan.
Gentlemen: As director of the Hygienic Laboratory, I wish to
make the following suggestions for your consideration:
First, I suggest that by resolution you instruct the laboratory
assistant in charge of water analysis to report to the Secretary
of the University within twenty-four hours after the receipt of the
sample of water for analysis, that such a sample has been received,
with the name and address of the sender, and that as soon as the
analysis is completed the analyst shall make out two full and complete reports of the results of the examination, one of which shall
be immediately transmitted to the Secretary of the University, while
the other is placed on file in the laboratory.
The reasons for these suggestions are as follows: When an
epidemic of typhoid fever is threatened the health officer sends a
sample of water, and of course he wishes to receive the report as
soon as possible.  The suggestion made above gives Mr. Wade
ample opportunity to report to the health officer that a sample has
been received and that the analysis is being carried on, and that the
analysis must be paid for. There has been some complaint from
health officers, and there is some justice in it, that the report of the
examination is delayed, and in this way opportunity is given for the
epidemic to spread before the result of the analysis is known.
Second, I wish to suggest that you inform the laboratory assistant in charge of the Pasteur Institute that within two days after
the arrival of a new patient for treatment at the institute he shall
report the name and address of such patient to the Treasurer of the
University, and that a second report shall be made when the treat



52


ANOVEMBER MEETING, 90o6.


ment is completed, and that under no circumstances shall any one
save the Treasurer of the University receive or handle' any money
for the Pasteur treatment of patients.  The reasons for making
these suggestions are briefly as follows: Up to the present time the
laboratory assistant in charge oI the Pasteur Institute has in many
cases, not in all, taken money for treatment and turned it over to
the Treasurer of the University. This gives a possible opportunity
for serious neglect in turning over such funds. Again, a considerable number of patients come to the Pasteur Institute for treatment
in accordance with a statute passed by the legislature of 1903, providing for the payment of the treatment of such cases among indigent people. The laboratory assistant in charge of the Pasteur
Institute has no authority for seeing that this money is collected,
while the Treasurer of the University would have more power and
could very properly cite the authorities to the statute referred to.
I wish also to be permitted to have printed at the University
press blank forms for the record of cases treated in the Pasteur
Institute, the number of treatments that each patient receives and
any other information of value pertaining to the work.  These
reports will in time be of great value to the University, and they
should be preserved in better shape and in more permanent form
than is now  done. At present these reports are all kept in a
note-book which may be lost, and which does not provide for a
uniform report of results. Furthermore, I would suggest that the
Director of the laboratory be permitted to have printed at the University press cards which'may be sent to the health officers desiring
to send samples of water for analysis, such cards to serve as direction
tags on the express packages in which the waters are sent.
I believe that attention to these matters will improve these two
very important lines of work, and will make this work much more
satisfactory both to the University and to the people who are served
by the work.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
V. C. VAUGHAN, Dean.
Regent Carey moved that for the purpose of balancing
the several building accounts on the Treasurer's books, the
Finance Committee be authorized to cause such transfers
on the Auditor General's books as will accomplish the purpose.
On motion the Board adjourned to Saturday, December
8th, at Io o'clock A. M.

Secretary.

ANN ARBOR, MlICH., January 14, 1907.
To the Board of Regents, University of Michigan:
Gentlemren-On account of the increase in number of students
required to take Qualitative Analysis during the coming semester, it
will be necessary to make some provision for a slight increase in
our teaching capacity in order that the instructors in that line of
work may not be excessively overloaded. Robert J. Carney is at
present laboratory assistant in Analytical Chemistry at a salary of
$200 per annum, but his duties consist of supervision of laboratory
work only. It will be necessary to make some provision for increasing the staff available for class work in Qualitative Analysis as the
increase in sections would be too much for Dr. Balcom and Professor Johnson to carry. I would therefore recommend that Mr.
Carney's position be changed from that of a laboratory assistant at

enable us to call on Mr. Carney to take part of the class work as
well as laboratory work in Qualitative Analysis and will enable us
to relieve Dr. Balcom and Professor Johnson from an overload in
class work. The change for the remainder of the year will increase
the salary budget $Ioo more than at the present time.
Oscar H. Wurster, at present first teaching assistant in General
and Physical Chemistry, has resigned to accept a position in Cincinnati. This resignation will necessitate some rearrangement in the
teaching staff for next semester, and I would therefore make the
following recommendations:
That Jacob Moyer, now second teaching assistant in General
Chemistry, be advanced to that of first teaching assistant to succeed
Mr. Wurster.
That Edward L. Hendrick, now assistant in General Chemistry
under Dr. Bigelow, be appointed second teaching assistant in General Chemistry to succeed Mr. Moyer.
That Alfred E. Perkins, now laboratory assistant in General
Chemistry, be appointed to succeed Mr. Hendrick.
That Orrett Tatlock be appointed to succeed Mr. Perkins.
This rearrangement will involve no change in the salary budget.
At the time Professor O. C. Johnson was appointed Professor
of Applied Chemistry, he gave a lecture-course in this subject and
his title properly represented the subject which he taught. For
several years Professor Johnson has taught Qualitative Analysis
only, and at his request I would ask that his title be changed to that
of Professor of Qualitative Analysis.
At the time Mr. W. G. Smeaton was appointed Instructor in
Chemical Engineering, his work was under the immediate direction
of this Department.  Since the reorganization of the laboratory,
Mr. Smeaton has been teaching General Chemistry only, and I
would therefore recommend that his title be changed from that of
Instructor in Chemical Engineering to that of Instructor in General
Chemistry.
Respectfully submitted,
E. D. CAMPBELL.
Miss Allie Gates, clerk in the office of the Secretary of
the Department of Enghieering, gave notice of her intention
to resign in March next.   On motion of Regent Dean, Mrs.
Camille B. Green was appointed to the place, at a salary of

next.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, the salary of Librarian
Koch was made $3,000, to take effect October I, 1907, by

FEB RUARY MEETING, 1907.


Honorable Board of Regents:
Gentlemen-I hope the Board will see its way clear at this meeting to add $50 to the salary of the janitors and teamsters. Living
expenses are so high it is impossible for these men to live and support a family on $500. There is some unrest among them on account
of the increase granted to men in the engineering shops and the
firemen and coal passers at the heating plant,: which was made at
the last meeting of the Board. Their case was deferred until this
meeting.                   Very respectfully,
J. H. WADE.
In accordance with this recommendation of Secretary
Wade, Regent White moved that $50 be added to the salary
of each of the janitors and teamsters who act under Superintendent Reeve's direction, and the motion was passed by
the following vote:
Aye-Regents Dean, Barbour, Carey, Knappen, White,
Hill and Sawyer; Regent Fletcher not voting.
On recommendation of the Hospital Committee of the
Medical Faculty of the Department of Medicine and Surgery, and on motion of Regent Barbour, A. M. Barrett,
M. D., was appointed Professor of Psychiatry and Diseases
of the Nervous System, and charged with the immediate
care of the clinic of Nervous Diseases, without salary from
the University, and also it was vQted that a clinical professor
of Nervous Diseases should be appointed in the future, at a
salary of $2,000. Carried by a full vote of the Board.

The President was directed to return the thanks of the
Board to the several donors.
Dean Cooley sent also the following communication:
ANN ARBOR, February 20, I907.
HON. JAMES B. ANGELL,
President Board of Regents.
Sir-The $I5,ooo equipment fund appropriated by the Regents in
June last contained an item of $1,350 for a rope-drive for the
mechanical laboratory.
While in Chicago last fall I learned of two multiple stage aircompressors working up to 2,500 lbs. pressure, formerly in use by
the Chicago Union Traction Co. for street car service.
These, on examination, were found to be in fairly good condition, and, with such an overhauling as could be given them in our
shops, would be adapted to the proposed experimental work in our
laboratory for which an appropriation has been asked several times.
The two machines are being considered, as the capacity of one is
insufficient.
I am now in correspondence with the general manager and the
chief engineer of the Chicago Union Traction Co. relative to the
purchase of these machines. I have been led to anticipate a very low
price on them. If, when their proposition is received, it is found to
be favorable, I beg to request permission to expend as much of the
sum set apart for a rope-drive as may be necessary, deferring the
purchase of a rope-drive to a later period.
The object of this request is simply to save $2,0.00 or more, if
it can be done.               Respectfully yours,
M. E. COOLEY.
His request was granted by a full vote of the Board, on
motion of Regent Dean.




FEBRUARY MEETING, I907.

Dean Cooley presented the following communication:
February 20, I907.
HON. JAS. B. ANGELL,
President Board of Regents:
Sir-I beg to call your attention to the desire of a number of
professors and instructors to be permitted to have telephones
installed in their offices on the Campus, the same to be paid for by
them personally at the University rate. In recommending this I
have in mind not so much the convenience of the teacher himself
as that of the officers and others who may desire to reach the teacher
without making a search for him, thereby saving much time.
Respectfully,
M. E. COOLEY.
This request was laid upon the table for further consideration.
Librarian Koch presented the following communication:
ANN ARBOR, MICH., Jan. I8, I907.
Honorable Board of Regents,
University of Michigan:
Gentlemen-One of the stained glass windows presented to the
University last September is about thirteen -inches shorter than the
other three windows, and in order to lengthen it and so utilize it
for the apse of the library I have designed a memorial panel reading:
IN MEMORIAM
EDWARD LORRAINE WALTER
Lost at Sea, July 4, i898.
Professor Walter left his library to this University and the
plan is to put this window directly over his portrait, which hangs on
the west wall of the apse. As the main feature of the window is a
ship under full sail it would seem particularly appropriate as a
memorial in this instance. I therefore venture to ask for a special
appropriation of twenty-five dollars to cover the cost of this panel.
Respectfully submitted,
THEO. W. KOCH,
Librarian.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, it was voted to appropriate $25 as requested for this purpose, by a full vote of the
Board..

That, as regards the particular question now under discussion,

M AY MEETING, 1907.


ANN ARBOR, MICH., May 8, 1907.
To the Honorable Board of Regents, University of Michigan:
Gentlelmen —The  University  of Michigan  News-Letter has
printed at irregular intervals for the last few years lists of publications by members of the Faculty.
Mr. Shaw and I are of the opinion that by having this list compiled at the University Library and printed as an appendix to the
Librarian's Report, it could not only be done better, but would reach
those who are particularly interested in the publications of our
professors. As the files of our library reports are kept in more
university and college libraries than the News-Letter, the lists would
be more likely preserved than when issued in the News-Letter. We,
therefore, request your authorization to compile the list for January,
906 —June 30, 1907, as an appendix to the next annual report of the
librarian.         Respectfully submitted,
THI:O. W. KOCH,
Librarian.
Regent Knappen submitted       the following   resolution,
which was adopted by the full Board:
Resolved, That a special committee, consisting of three members
of this Board and three members of the University Senate, be
appointed to make a study of the arrangement of the campus and the
placing of new buildings, and to prepare a plan to be submitted to
this Board.
The resolution was adopted by the Board and the President named the following committee: Regents Knappen,
Fletcher and Hill, Deans Cooley and Hutchins, and Professor Kelsey.
A recess was then taken until 2 o'clock P. r.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
The   Board   reassembled  at 2 o'clock    p. M., Regent
Fletcher being present.
The President read the following communication from
Professor M. L. D'Ooge:
ANN ARBOR, May 8, 1907.
To the President and the Honorable, the Board of Regents:
Geltlemen-I desire to announce to you that Hon. Peter White,
a member of your Honorable Board, has very generously contributed
the sum of three hundred dollars for the continuance of the Fellowship in Classics named for him.




MA4Y MEETING, p907.


95


The Classical department, on behalf of which I make this
announcement, is deeply grateful to Mr. White for this aid and for
this renewed evidence of his personal interest in this department of
learning. The person to whom this fellowship is to be awarded for
the ensuing college year will be recommended to you for appointment
next September.  I have the honor to be
Yours most truly,
MARTIN L. D'OOG;.
On motion the gift was accepted and the thanks of the

JUNE 13 AMEETING, 1907.


On motion of Regent Dean, the requests in the following
communication from Dean Cooley were granted by a unanimous vote:
ANN ARBOR, June 13, 1907.
HON. JAMIES B. ANGELL,
President Board of Regents:
Sir-A year ago the Regents consented to the unexpended balance of the $I5,ooo appropriated for equipment being carried over
into the next fiscal year.
I. I beg to make the same request concerning the unexpended
balance of the equipment fund for this year. Some portions of this
fund have been held back pending an effort to purchase some special
machinery at a very favorable figure. As it was hoped this machinery would be in large part presented to the University, the final
arrangements for its purchase have not yet been consummated, and
the matter is of such a character that it can not well be forced.
2. The Regents last year set apart $2,500 for the department of
Architecture.  Professor Lorch has exercised much care in the
expenditure of this money, and owing to the fact that several hundred dollars of it are for books, bills for which have not yet been
received at the library, he requests that any unexpended balance of
this particular fund be continued into the next fiscal year.
Respectfully submitted,
M. E. COoLvY.
On motion of Regent Knappen and in accordance with
the request of the Law    Faculty, Theodore B. Perry, Jr.,
George H. Ross, and William      H. Stafford were excused
from attendance on Commencement exercises, because they
were obliged to be absent by reason of bar examinations.
On motion of Regent Carey, the sum of $200 was voted
unanimously to Mr. Harpham       for special services for the

The following communication was received from        Professor Lloyd:
ANN ARRBOR, June 13, I907.
To the President and Regents of the University of M/ichigan:
Dear Sirs-Mrs. George S. Morris having renewed her gift of
$450 for maintenance of a fellowship or scholarship in Philosophy,

Very respectfully yours,
ALFRrD H. LLOYD.

FRIDAY MORNING SESSION.
On motion of Regent Barbour, it was voted that the sum
of $125 be added to the budget of the clinic, to be used by
Dr. Dock in connection with his department, by a call vote.
The communication of Dr. Dock was as follows:
ANN ARBOR, June 13, I907.
Honorable Board of Regents,
University of Michigan:
Gentlemen-I request permission to make the following substitute in my clinic in place of the request made by the Hospital
Committee in the matter of internes and internes' salaries. I shall
not have an assistant who can live in the hospital, as proposed by
the action of the Hospital Committee. At the same time there is
urgent need to have some one in the hospital at night to answer
calls, to make notes of patients' condition and to report.to me or my
assistants in the morning. I therefore request permission to allow
my undergraduate staff, some ten in number, members of the senior
class, to take turns, live in the hospital in the interne's quarters, get
their meals, and carry out such duties as may be assigned them.
I further request that pending the solution of the interne prob

be added to the budget of the clinic.

JUNE MEETING
UNIVERSITY OF M/ICHIGAN,

The Board assembled in the Regents' room        at Io
o'clock A. M. Full Board present except Regent Knappen.
The President read the minutes of the last meeting,
which were, on motion of Regent Barbour, approved and

fifty dollars for the Woods Hole Scholarship, which pays the tuition
of a student for the summer at Woods Hole.
Mr. A. F. Scholl, an assistant in Zoology and a brother of the

DETROIT, June 15, I907.
To the Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
Gentlemen-Some years ago the writer had the good fortune to
come into possession of the library desk of former President Tappan,
of the University. For a long time I have entertained the thought




106


JUNE i8 MEETING, 1907.


that so interesting a souvenir of the loved and distinguished man and
scholar, who, as the first President of our State University, was
responsible for the advanced and broad plan which has since made
Michigan's great school famous and renowned throughout the
world, should or might form the nucleus of a collection of personal
belongings of President Tappan, that would serve to awaken fond
memories in the hearts of those who were privileged to number
themselves among his "old boys" and to share with him those eleven
trying but stirring and eventful years of his incumbency, and that
would be a source of pleasure and inspiration to all who wear, or
may hereafter wear, old Ann Arbor's colors, the "Yellow and the
Blue."
Under consideration was the question whether this collection
would most fittingly be housed in Detroit, the city which claims
the proud distinction of having been the first home of the University, the "Catholepistemiad of Michigania," as it was named at its
real birth in 1817, or in Ann Arbor, the city in which it was centralized and began its later career under the guidance and control of
the master mind of its first President. However, the matter was
quickly decided when, in conversation with Regent Barbour, one of
Dr. Tappan's old boys, he suggested that your Board might be glad
to provide a suitable corner for it on the campus.
The history of the desk may be told in a few words. When Dr.
Tappan was leaving Ann Arbor, in 1863, he presented most of the
furnishings of his study to his close friend and associate, Prof.
Williams, in whose study they remained until the latter's death in
188I. They were retained intact, in the room, which had been Prof.
Williams' study, by his family when the writer was appointed to the
University in I885. Myself and family made our home with Mrs.
Williams, during our first year in Ann Arbor, and among others
had the room containing Dr. Tappan's things for my office and study.
I was much gratified when I succeeded in persuading Mrs.
Williams to let me have the desk, not so much because they were
Dr. Tappan's, whose great service to Michigan and its University I
did not learn to appreciate so fully until later, during the SemiCentennial celebration I listened to President Angell's glowing and
generous tribute to his predecessor's learning and ability; but because
I had in my student days become so familiar with good old Prof.
Williams, who had then only just retired from the active list. The
desk is flat-top, with extension leaves at the end, made of the dark
wood so much in vogue at that time, quite elaborate and comprehensive, too, for those days. I have carefully preserved its original
features, so that I think it is now exactly as when it stood in Dr.




JUNE I8 MlEETING, 1907.


107


Tappan's own study. It seems to me doubly valuable, as a souvenir
of both the first President and of the first Professor of the University. For a halo surrounds the memory of Prof. Williams, who held
the first chair in the University, welcomed its first student to Ann
Arbor, gave the diplomas to the first class graduated, and whose
official connection with the University, from his appointment in 1837
to the hour of his death in I88I, was never broken.
I take pleasure in offering it to the University, through your
honorable Board, merely stipulating that s-hoould a future Board of
Regents, or custodian who "Knew not Joseph," omit to care for it,
or relegate it to some cobweb-covered attic, that the desk may revert
to myself or legal representatives.  Trusting that it may prove
acceptable and that it may be found possible to add to it other
articles of Presid'ent Tappan's so as to form a worthy and noticeable
collection, to which I pledge you my earnest endeavor to further
contribute, I have the honor to remain
Very respectfully yours,
D. A. MACLACHLAN.
Professor H. C. Adams asked for and obtained an extension of his leave of absence for another year, upon the
condition that he shall provide for his University work
during his absence without expense to the University.
Dr. Adams also gave notice that he desired to return to
the University $450, being the unexpended balance of his
salary for last year, this money to be used in the purchase
of books for the departments of Political Economy, Sociology and Higher Commercial Education.
Professor Hussey subnitted plans for the enlargement
of the Observatory to accommodate the new telescope now
under construction.  The plans were referred to the Committee on Buildings and Grounds for an estimate of cost.
Communications were received from the several Faculties recommending candidates for degrees.    On motion of
the chairmen of the appropriate committees, the recommendations were approved and the degrees were ordered to
be conferred as indicated in the list given below, by the full
vote of the Board:

pose stated in the following communication. He was also

ANN ARBOR, MICH., June 28, 1907.
To the Honorable B.oard of Regents:
Gentlemen-I hereby ask that you grant me a leave of absence
of two weeks, at the beginning of the next session. The reason for
this request is as follows: On September I6 the International AntiTuberculosis Congress meets in Vienna, and ten days later, on September 26, the International Congress of Hygiene meets in Berlin.
I am on the American committees of both of these congresses;
besides, I have been requested to read a paper embodying my
research work at the Congress in Berlin. Both of these congresses
hold their next meeting in the United States. The Anti-T'uberculosis
Congress will meet in September and October of 90o8, and the
Congress of Hygiene in I9Io. I think it quite important that the

SEPTEMBER MEETING
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, |
ANN ARBOR, Sept. 27, I907.
The Board assembled in the Regents' room at Io o'clock
A. M.
Full Board present, except Regents Hill and Fletcher.
The Secretary read the minutes of the last meeting,
which were, on motion of Regent Barbour, approved and
ordered to be printed.
Sundry communications which had reached the President
were placed in the hands of the Standing Committees of
the Board for consideration.
The President submitted his Annual Report which was,
on motion, accepted and the usual number of copies ordered
to be printed for distribution.
To the Regents of the University:
I present you ny Annual Report for the year ending
September 20, I907.
As in the previous year we have suffered heavy affliction
by the death of three members of our Faculties.
On Dec. 14, I906, William James Herdman, M. D.,
LL.D., Professor of Diseases of the Mind and Nervous
System, and of Electro-Therapeutics, in the Department of
Medicine and Surgery, died after a brief illness in Baltimore, Md., while on his way to Europe. He was graduated
from the Literary Department in 1872, and from the Medical
Department in I875. He had been connected with the
Medical Department in various capacities since 1875, and
had rendered most valuable service. It is especially due to
his labors that the state was led to establish the Psychopathic Ward, which has proved of sol great service to patients
in the incipient stages of insanity, and to alienists in the
study of some of their difficult problems.




150


SLEPTEMBER MEETING,.907.


On June r8th, in the midst of the festivities of Commencement Week, William Harold Payne, Ph.D., LL.D.,
D.Litt., Professor of the Science and the Art of Teaching,
died after a prolonged illness. He was the first to fill such
a chair in, an American University. Though when he was
appointed in 1879, not a few educators doubted whether
such a Professorship could be made of practical use, he by
his careful study of the problem of preparing college students for the work of the teacher, brought to his task such
wisdom and good sense and pedagogical skill that criticism
of the plan was soon silenced, and similar chairs have now
been established in most of the prominent universities of the
country. In 1887 he was chosen by the Trustees of the
Peabody Educational Fund chancellor of the University of
Nashville and head of the Peabody Normal College. For
fourteen years he held that position and rendered invaluable
service to the cause of education in the South. On the death
of Professor Hinsdale, who had succeeded him here, he
consented to return to his former post. He discharged his
duties with his characteristic fidelity, until the disease which
finally carried him  off, made encroachments upon his
strength. By his writings as well as by his class-room
teaching he made valuable contributions to his profession.
I-Ie was a man of singularly pure and beautiful spirit.
On July 27th Wililoughby Dayton Miller, A. B., Ph.D.,
D. D. S., M. D., who had just resigned 'his Professorship
in the University of Berlin to accept the Deanship of our
Dental School, died in Newark, Ohio, after an operation for
appendicitis. This calamity is a peculiarly severe trial to
the School. Dr. Miller, by his scientific investigations in
Berlin has won a world-wide reputation, and he, as well as
we, were looking forward with great delight to his work with
us. He was a graduate of our Literary Department in I875.
He afterward studied physics under Sir William Thompson
in Edinburgh and later at the University of Berlin.
He became interested while there in certain relations of
chemistry and bacteriology to the dental art, and completed
the dental course at the University of Pennsylvania. In
I884 he was made Professor of Odontology in the University of Berlin. His scientific researches secured for him a




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1907.


151


high reputation both in Europe and in America. We have
sought for years to persuade him to accept a chair in our
Dental Department. Finally, although the authorities of
the University of Berlin made earnest efforts to retain him,
he consented to accept the Deanship of our Dental School,
and had completed his arrangements to begin his work with
us at this time. His death is mourned not only by us, but
by the whole dental profession of the country, and by his
scientific associates in Germany.
The attendance (including the Summer Session oif
1906), was 4,746, the highest figure ever reached in our
history; excluding the Summer Session, it was 4,282. In
the regular attendance the gain in the Literary Department
over that of the previous year was 125; in the Engineering
Department 43, in the Dental Department 46. In the Law
Department there was a decline of I34. There was a slight
gain in each of the other departments.  The attendance
from other states still continues gratifying, e. g., Ohio 408,
Illinois 315, New York 299, Indiana I98, Pennsylvania I81,
Missouri 75, Iowa 73, Wisconsin 50, Colorado 44, Montana
34, Kansas 31, Kentucky 30, California 27, New England
52. Forty-three states and all of our territories (except
Alaska), our Insular Possessions and sixteen foreign states
and provinces are represented.
The decline in law  students is not easily explained,
though a similar decline in other important law schools and
the well known increase in the numbers of recent graduates
from  American universities who are turning to business
pursuits may indicate, and probably does indicate, that the
great business prosperity of the country is attracting a considerable number of the class who have, heretofore, turned
to the study of law.   There have been signs that the
professions of law and medicine are becoming overcrowded,
and many of the medical schools, like the law schools, show
a diminished attendance.*
*NoT;.-The fact that the Freshman Law Class, which has
entered in September, I907, since the above was written, is larger by
about a hundred than that of last year, makes it still more difficult
to understand the shrinkage of last year.




152


SEPTEMBER MEETING, I907.


The attendance! of women not including the Summer
School, has been as follows, for the last two years:
1905-6  1906-7
Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts.... 680  697
Department  of  Engineering.......................  I
Department of Medicine and Surgery.............  25  24
Department of Law...............................  2
Department of Pharmacy..........................  I  2
Homceopathic Medical College....................    9
College  of Dental  Surgery.......................  3  8
720     74I
The slight gain, it will be observed, is almost wholly in
the Literary Department. The steadiness of the attendance
for several years is noteworthy. The number of women in
the Summer School in I906-7, who were not in the regular
courses, was 140, an increase of 29 over the previous year.
In the Literary Department there were in all I89, in the
Medical II, in the Law I.
Professor Hudson, who has held the office of Dean of
the Literary Department for the last ten years, has resigned
that position in order to give his undivided attention to his
work in history. He has discharged the duties of Dean with
great fidelity.  With the increasing number of students
those duties are constantly becoming more arduous and make
heavy demands on the time and thought of the incumbent
of the office. Professor Reed, who has been appointed to
succeed Professor Hudson, has had experience as Dean of
the Summer School, which has served to prepare him for
his new post.
Other universities and institutions seeking competent
men appear to have formed the habit of looking to our
Faculties for their supply. However complimentary this
may be to us, the honor is attended with some inconveniences
to us. We are quite unwilling to part with good men.
Dr. McMurrich, for the last thirteen years our Professor
of Anatomy in the Department of Medicine and Surgery,
has resigned, in order to accept a similar post in the University of Toronto. This carries him back to his native city




SEPTEMBER MEETING, I907.


153


and to his Alma Mater. We regret to lose a man of so
wide learning and of such unusual gifts as a teacher.
We have appointed to succeed him    Dr. George L.
Streeter, A. B., M. D., who has made excellent studies in
this country and abroad, and has had honorable appointments at the Johns Hopkins Medical School and at the
Wistar Institute.
Dr. Arthur Fairbanks, who has been with us but a short
time as Professor of Greek and Greek Archaeology, has
received the high honor of appointment as Director of the
Boston Art Museum with a generous salary. This is a
flattering recognition of his critical knowledge of ancient
art and of his administrative ability.
We have selected as his successor Dr. Campbell Bonner
of Vanderbilt University, who has won recognition from
leading classical scholars by his contributions to classical
journals.
We have strengthened the Engineering Faculty by the
appointment as Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering of
J. H. Griffith, M.S., who has had experience in railroad
construction and in structural work in iron and steel, and
as Professor of Electrical Engineering C. L. DeMuralt,
C. E., a graduate of the Polytechnic School of Zurich, who
pursued graduate studies at the University of Munich and
had been engaged for over ten years in practical. work of
construction and as Instructor in Mechanical Engineering
of Stanislaus Zowsky, who was educated at the Polytechnic
School of Zurich and at Charlottenburg.
The currents of student life have flowed on pretty
smoothly during the past year. The silly and sometimes
dangerous amusement of "hair-cutting" was omitted, and
the friendly contests of the two lower classes in the trials
of strength and cunning were carried on under supervision
of upper classmen and under regulations. This prevented
serious bodily injuries and bad blood. For these reforms
we are largely indebted to the organization known as the
Student Council', composed of men elected by the body of
students to secure the wise management of their affairs. I
take pleasure in testifying to. the great good sense and the
excellent spirit, with which they have carried on their work.

In my last report I had occasion to express our satisfaction that notwithstanding the attractiveness and strength of
our professional schools and in spite of the strong desire of
so many young men to hasten unduly into their professional
life the largest increase of students was registered in the
Literary Department. It is gratifying to observe the same
facts this year. It shows that the sane opinion is gaining
ground among our constituency that it is wise for all who
can to lay a broad and strong foundation for professional
study in the disciplinary training of the collegiate course.
I need hardly add that this imposes on the authorities of the
University the duty of enriching and strengthening the work
of the Literary Department by every method at their command, as the source and centre of the intellectual life of the
institution.
The Department of Medicine and Surgery by your
authority has taken a very important step. It has announced
that begining with the autumn of I909 no student may be
admitted to the Department who has not previously complied
with the requirements for admission to the Literary Department and obtained credit for sixty hours (two years) oif
work. In the sixty hours of work is to be credit for certain
specified subjects which are essential as preparatory to
medical study. A number of the medical schools connected
with universities are making a similar requirement. In
some it is not to be insisted on until 191o. No one of the
professions is doing more to raise the standard of pieparation for admission to its ranks than that of medicine.
The National Dental Association having insisted that
we make a large increase in our demands for fees from
students as a condition of the membership of our school in
that organization, you have very properly instructed our
Dental Faculty to withdraw from the society. We cannot
allow any society to determine at what cost to the student
the State of Michigan shall furnish education.
In addition to the work of instruction, the energies of
the Observatory during the past year have been devoted
more largely to construction than to observation. Many
improvements have been made in the instruments. The
large refractor in particular has been thoroughly rebuilt,




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1907.


155


making it an efficient modern instrument. So numerous
have been the changes in this telescope that it may almost
be regarded as new. The old unstable wooden tube has
been replaced by a new and very rigid one of sheet steel.
The other new parts include the draw tube, worm and worm
wheel, driving clock, clamps and slow motions in right
ascension and in declination, and coarsely graduated circles
for rapidly setting the instrument. Electric illumination has
been provided for the micrometer and for reading the coarse
circles, both controlled from the eye end. All of these
parts have been made in the Observatory shop and fitted by
the Observatory instrument makers. A new position filar
micrometer, made by the Warner & Swasey Company of
Cleveland, has also been fitted to the instrument. Recently,
since the completion of its reconstruction, this telescope has
been used for observation of Mars and of comets and double
stars.
Last year steps were taken toward acquiring a large
reflecting telescope for photographic and spectroscopic work,
and satisfactory progress has been made in its construction.
After a number of trials, a suitable disk of glass was
successfully cast by the St. Gobain Works, in France, and
forwarded in May to the opticians, the John A. 'Brashear
Company of Allegheny. They have commenced the optical
work and it is probable that the great mirror will be finished
within a few months. The disk of glass is to all appearances
of excellent quality and will finish appreciably larger than
ordered, giving'a clear aperture of about thirty-seven inches.
The design for the mounting or machinery of this telescope has been made at the Observatory during the year,
and the detailed working drawings for shop use for a large
portion of it are completed.   For several months the
construction of the instrument has been in progress in the
Engineering and Observatory Shiops and is proceeding
satisfactorily.
According to the report of the Librarian the total number
of volumes in our Libraries is 222,609, made up as follows:
General Library, 172,276; Law, 24,425; Medical, 16,569;
Dental, 1,626; Homceopathic, 2,596; Engineering and
Architecture, 4,4I5.




156


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1907.


The experiment of allowing the students to order books
under wise regulations has proved most satisfactory and has
been highly appreciated by the students.
The number of accessions to the libraries is one-third
larger than in any previous year. This rate of increase is
forcing on us a serious problem, namely, of finding room
for properly housing our books.   Some enlargement of
available space must at once be found, since we are adding
about 6,00ooo volumes a year.
It appears from the report of the Curator of the Art
Museum that during the past academic year II,600 persons
have visited our Art Gallery, although it is open only two
hours daily. He therefore very properly submits to you the
question whether it is not expedient to open it two hours
more in the day as many persons desire that we should.
The organization of the students known as the Michigan
Union will come to be an event of much importance in the
life of the University, if the expectations of its promoters
are in any considerable degree realized. Its aim is to establish a sort of headquarters or home, to, which the students
may resort in their leisure hours and there cultivate
acquaintance with each other. They have now no, common
meeting place, where they may meet in friendly social intercourse. Mlembers of fraternities may indeed meet in their
respective hotuses. But members of different fraternities
have no, gathering place, where they may form social ties
with each other. And a majority of our students are not
members of fraternities. For the last three or four years a
large number of our students and some of the members of
the Faculties have been carefully considering the problem
of finding a method of facilitating the intercourse of our
young men with each other.    Their efforts have finally
resulted in the purchase of the residence of the late Judge
Cooley as the home of the Michigan Union. The society
is making such alterations in the house as will adapt-it to its
new purpose. The situation contiguous to the campus is most
fortunate. The associations of the house, so long the abode
of one of the most distinguished and beloved of our Professors, lend great interest to it. If the Union, which is open
to all students at a moderate cost, is wisely conducted, the




SEPTEMBER MEETING, I907.


157


advantages should be very great. There is no graduate of a
college who does not recall some of the friendships formed
with fellow students as not only the most charming feature
of his undergraduate life, but also as having made as deep
and abiding impression on his mind and character as the
instruction received from his teachers. We have done too
little to furnish facilities for our students to meet each other
in their leisure hours and profit by social intercourse. We
may well do whatever we can to encourage the students in
establishing themselves under favoring conditions in the
home of the Michigan Union. And our alumni can render
no better service to us than by coming to the aid of the
students with generous contributions for the refitting and
the proper maintenance of the Cooley house.
The Students' Christian Association has of late years
rendered great service to our students by assisting the newcomers in finding rooms and by aiding all students in finding
employment, by which they may earn enough to pay a
portion of their expenses. During the last year they aided
in finding employment for 575 persons. The earnings of
these students amounted to several thousand dollars. It
has not been found practicable to determine the exact
amount. From the best information available, it seems
probable that at least 1,200 of the students are partially or
wholly meeting their expenses by their labor.
We have made an important addition to our facilities for
work by establishing telephonic communication between
our various buildings through an electrical plant of the most
modern construction.  Incidentally this fine plant is of
course of great assistance to our students of electrical
engineering.
It has long been obvious that owing to the rapid growth
of the University the campus would prove too small to
furnish sites for the buildings we should need at no distant
day. It is much to be regretted that long ago, when land
contiguous to! the tracts we own could have been secured at
low rates, we had not the means to purchase. But during
the last few years we have found the means to gain possession of some desirable lots, as for example, the Winchell
property and the First Ward School property. During the




158


SEPTEMBER MEETING, I907.


past year we have obtained at a moderate price a considerable tract adjacent to the University Hospital, which it is
very desirable we should control. We have also, in order
to procure the most desirable site for the new Dental College, purchased three houses on North University Avenue
and lots on which to place two of them. The third we have
removed to the University Hospital grounds, where it will
be used for the lodging of nurses. We also purchased a
commodious house and lot adjacent to the Homceopathic
Hospital, and the 'house will be used as a home for the
nurses in that hospital. 'There are other lots which a farsighted economy will prompt us to! buy, if the condition of
our treasury permits, before the market price is too much
enhanced.
It is gratifying to know that by strict economy you have
been able to provide for the erection of one of the several
buildings of which we are so! much in need. The work on
the Dental College is begun, and it will be a structure
admirably adapted to its purposes.
We are also grateful to the Alumni and other friends of
the University who have raised the sum of $I32,000 for the
erection of a Memorial Building, in which due honor is to
be paid to the gallant sons of the University who served
their country in the Civil war and the Spanish war, and to
the other men and women who by their lives have rendered
worthy service to the University. By a happy thought you
have also decided to appropriate fifty thousand dollars from
the University treasury, which added to the sum raised by
contributions, enables the architect to plan the building so
as to receive the Art Collection now in the Library Building.
The removal of that collection will furnish large additional
space, now urgently needed, for the General Library.
But when all this is done, we are still in most pressing
need of other large and costly' builings.  It must be
remembered that a large part of the old Medical Building is
condemned and' useless. We should provide for the men
excluded from that building. We must have soon a building
for the scientific teachers in the Literary Department who
require laboratories and lecture rooms for instruction in
botany, zoology, mineralogy and geology. We need sorely




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1907.


159


larger and better accommodations for the work in history
and political economy. The old Chemical Laboratory is
both worn out and outgrown. It has not room for the
classes which overcrowd it. The new Engineering Building
is already outgrown and should have at once a fifty thousand
dollar enlargement.
We have found     ourselves under the necessity  of
increasing the salaries of a considerable number of our
teachers. We had been unable to take such a step for many
years. Meantime it is a matter of common knowledge that
house rents, servants' wages, and all the expenses of living
in this town have largely increased.   Moreover other
universities have been drawing from us some of our best
teachers by offering them larger salaries than ours. During
the last twelvemonth an unusual number of such calls have
come to the members of our Faculties. Of course they
commonly come to the men whom we can least afford to lose.
Our scale of salaries is still materially below that of several
universities, who often covet some of our professors. It
should be remembered too that the system of pensioning
elderly or disabled professors, which some universities
adopted years ago, and which Mr. Carnegie by a special
endowment has made applicable to most of the stronger
colleges and universities, but not to the state universities,
acts as a premium to, attract men from us. It will be seen
therefore that we have been driven by circumstances to an
increase of salaries as a step indispensable to the maintenance of a staff of the first rank in scholarship and reputation.
We have received some gratifying tokens of generous
interest in us by large minded benefactors.
Hon. A. M. Todd of Kalamazoo 'has enriched our
Museum   and Art Gallery with valuable archaeological
specimens from Egypt and a fine copy of the noted piece of
statuary, the Wrestlers.
He also offered five prizes of One Hundred Dollars each
for the best essay on each of five economic and ethical
subjects which he proposed. They were open to seniors of
this year and of.last year in every department of the University. Three of these prizes were awarded-one to a member
of the graduating class of the Literary Department, and two




160


SEPTEMBER MEETING, I907.


to men graduating from    the Law   Department (who had
however previously taken a Bachelor's degree from college).
Our friends, who have so often remembered us in a
similar way, Hon. D. M. Ferry, Parke, Davis & Co.,
Frederick Stearns & Co., Theodore D. Buhl, Hon. Peter
White, Mrs. George S. Morris, and Bryant Walker, have
continued Felliowships and Scholarships.
We desire to remember with special gratitude the Legislature for their almost unanimous action in raising the
appropriation for the support of the University from onefourth to one-third of a mill. Under the present appraisal
of the property of the state, that adds $216,762 to our annual
income. We were in sore need of such help. We appreciate it, not only because of the timely addition to our
resources, but because it furnishes fresh and encouraging
evidence that the citizens of our state are ever ready to
sustain us in all reasonable endeavors to maintain the
University on a high plane of usefulness. We can assure
them that we shall continue to administer it with prudence
and economy and secure for it the highest efficiency compatible with the resources which they place at our command.
JAMES B. ANGELL.
The President submitted the following report of the
Executive Committee, which was approved by the full
Board.
ANN ARBOR, MICH., September 25, I907.
To the Board of Regents:
The Executive Committee beg leave to make the following
report of their action since the last meeting of the Board.
It will be remembered that at that meeting, owing to the contemplated absence of Regent Barbour from the country during the
summer, Regent Knappen was appointed by you to act in his stead
as a member of this Committee.
On July 8 we promoted Junior Professor Dr. S. L. Bigelow to
the rank of Professor of General and Physical Chemistry at the
salary of $2,500. He had been invited to accept a professorship of
chemistry at the University of Illinois at the salary of $2,500.
On July I7th the Committee having learned that Mr. F. L.
Paxson, Assistant Professor of American History, had been called
to Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., as Professor of History at the




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1907.


161


salary of $2,000, decided to promote him to the Junior Professorship
of American History, in order to retain him.
On July 20th the Committee appointed Dr. George L. Streeter,
A.M., M.D., Professor of Anatomy in the Department of Medicine
and Surgery in the place of Dr. McMurrich, resigned, at the salary
of $3,000. Dr. Streeter was graduated A.B. from Union College in
I895; A.M. and M.D. from Columbia University in 1899; was Demonstrator of Anatomy in Albany Medical College in 1901-2; was a
research student in the Universities of Berlin and Leipzig in 1902-3;
was Instructor in Johns Hopkins University and later Associate
Professor in the Wistar Institute of Philadelphia.  Several very
creditable researches have been published by him. He has visited
Ann Arbor and has made a very favorable impression.
The Committee learned that by some inadvertence a request
from Dr. Barrett and Dr. Peterson that the salary of Mr. Hale,
photographer at the University Hospital, should be increased from
$400 to $7.00, failed to receive the attention of the Regents, and
therefore on July 15 they assured Mr. Hale that they will recommend
this increase to the Board. Accordingly they do so recommend at
this time.
On August 21 the Committee learned that Assistant Professor
John S. P. Tatlock had been invited to take the chair of English in
the University of Cincinnati at a salary of $2,500, with some perquisites added, and a prospect of increase of salary at no distant
date. They found that he would be inclined to remain here if he
were promoted to a Junior Professorship with the salary of $2,500.
In view of his high attainments and faithful service of eight years,
the Committee decided to recommend him to your Board for that
promotion.
Also, the Committee appointed H. W. Allinger Instructor in
German one year at $9oo. This action was under the authorization
of the Regents to appoint an Instructor.
Also, S. L. Wolff was appointed for one year, at the salary of
$1,200, Instructor in Rhetoric, to teach in the Law Department in the
position vacated by the transfer of Mr. Rankin to the Literary
Department.
On September Io the Committee appointed, as they had been
authorized to do by you, William C. Titcomb, A.B., Instructor in
Drawing for the coming year at a salary of $9oo. Mr. Titcomb is a
graduate of Harvard, and has pursued special studies in Architecture. It is thought that his services will be valuable in the instruction
in Architecture.
On the Ioth of September the Executive Committee appointed
Mr. C. L. de Muralt, C.E., Professor of Electrical Engineering for




162


SEPTEMBER MEETING, I907.


one year, at a salary of $2,500. He is a graduate of the Polytechnic
School at Zurich, and pursued graduate studies at the University of
Munich, and has had ten years of experience in telephonic and
telegraphic work.
On September 12 the Committee appointed Mr. S. Zowski
Mech. E., Instructor in Mechanical Engineering for the coming year
at a salary of $1,200. Mr. Zowsky is a graduate of the University
of Berlin. He has been engaged in construction work for the last
two years.
Mr. George Maris, one of the assistants in the Waterman
Gymnasium, having been appointed to a more remunerative position
in Notre Dame University, the Executive Committee have, on the
recommendation of Mr. Fitzpatrick, appointed Mr. George R. Corneal
to the position which Mr. Maris held for one year, and at the same
salary, $800 a year.
The Committee appointed Mr. Ralph Hamilton Curtiss, Ph.D.,
Assistant Professor of Astro-Physics at the salary of $I,6oo for three
years.
Also, Mr. Ermine Coles Case, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of
Historical Geology and Paleontology for three years at the salary of
$I,6oo.
JAMES B. ANGELL,
For the Committee.
C. L. de Muralt, Professor of Electrical Engineering,
asked for and obtained leave of absence for one month to
render service to the Austrian government as consulting
engineer.
On the recommendation of Professor Cooley and on
motion of Regenlt Dean, Mr. H. H. Higbie's title was
changed   from  Instructor in Mechanical Engineering to
Instructor in Electrical Engineering, his salary remaining
$I,300, and Mr. Fred C. Purcell, B.S. (M.E.), was appointed
Instructor in Mechanical Engineering for one year, salary
$1,200.
On motion of Regent Dean, the resignation of William
S. Hazelton, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering, was accepted.
Regent Dean submitted the following communication
from  Dean Cooley, and the appointments therein recommended were made by the full vote of the Booard:

168


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1907.


from  the librarian, and the recommendations therein contained were approved by the full Board:
ANN ARBOR, MICH., September 24, I907.
The Honorable Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
I regret to report the following resignations from the Library
staff:
Miss Grace Lane (in charge of bills and accounts).
Miss May Goodrich (in charge of preparation of books for
binder).
Mrs. lone B. Fuller (in charge of preparation of.books for
shelves).
I would respectfully recommend the transfer of Miss Amanda
Belser from work on accessions to the position vacated by Miss
Lane, no increase of salary; transfer of Miss Marguerite Pattison
from the periodical room to Miss Belser's work on accessions, an
increase in salary for Miss Pattison from $350 to $400; transfer of
Miss Lydia Schleyer from the bindery to position vacated by Miss
Goodrich at Miss Schleyer's present salary, $400. Miss Schleyer has
worked in the bindery for seven years, and while transfer would
mean no increase in pay at present, it would be regarded as a promotion both by her and by Mr. Hollands, inasmuch as the hours of the
library are somewhat shorter than those in the bindery.    The
transfer is heartily endorsed by Mr. Hollands, in charge of the
bindery.
For the position in the periodical room I would recommend
the appointment of Miss Elizabeth Pond at the beginning salary of
$300.
Respectfully submitted,
THEODORE; W. KOCH, Librarian.
On motion of Regent Sawyer and on recommendation of
Librarian' Koch, Miss Rosalie      Mumford     was appointed
Assistant Classifier in the General Library at a salary of

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1907.

ANN ARBOR, MICH., September 27, I907.
Hon. Henry W. Carey, Member of Board of Regents, University
of Michigan:
As requested, I herewith transmit my report upon the cost of
installing the tunnel to the new Dental Building. This tunnel will
start at the present tunnel near the southwest corner of the Gymnasium, pass south and east of the Gymnasium and enter the Dental
Building just west of the center of the building.
The cost of the tunnel, including excavation and cement work,
would be as follows:
I,6o0 cu. yds. of excavation, at 40c...................... $ 640 oo
8,ooo cu. ft. of concrete, at I5c...........................,000 oo0
Total  cost  of  tunnel................................$I,640  oo
The cost of the steam piping will be practically the same,
whether this tunnel is installed or whether the piping passes through
the Gymnasium, as it will be necessary to take down the present
piping in the Gymnasium and install new piping, owing to the necessary increase in size. It would probably cost a little more to go
through the Gymnasium with the piping, as the work would be more
difficult to install. The cost of the piping has been estimated as
follows:
12-in. piping, 400 ft.................................... $800 oo
8-in  piping,  200  ft.......................................   2 00 oo
Valves and fittings......................................  224 00
Labor.................................................   300 oo
Total..................................$1,524 00oo
Respectfully submitted,
JOHN R. ALLEN.
On motion of Regent Carey, the question of providing
a building for the new     telescope at the Observatory was
referred to the Building Committee for consideration.
On motion of Regent Sawyer, $I25 was appropriated to
cover the expense of five new      cases to contain the Peter
Collier Collection of Minerals in the Mineralogical
Laboratory.
Director Fitzpatrick   requested that the small addition
to the Waterman Gymnasium be carried up two, stories.         It
was so ordered by the Board.

all stone work, of the proposed Memorial Building, which contract
the Committee consider very favorable, and have asked the Board
of Regents to execute such contract; and whereas, the consideration
of said contract is the sum of $I07,103, and there will be an additional
amount required for superintendence and architect's fees (assumed
to be approximately $5,000), and,
WHEREAS, There is now    in the Treasury of the University,
belonging to said building fund, the sum of about $78,000, and the
Board of Regents of said University are reluctant to enter into said

by the Board.
ANN ARBOR, MICH., September 26, 1907.
Hon. James B. Angell, President Board of Regents:
I. December 7 last I sent you a communication relating to
wages paid to men employed in the Engineering Shops.
The principal recommendation at that time was that a maximum
scale be established for the different positions, which should only
be paid with the consent of the Auditing Committee.
We are continually having demands for slight increases of wages
which  require me to come to the Regents with      unpleasant
frequentness.
Superintendent Miggett now recommends an increase from $3.00
to $3.50 for J. F. Harrington,' machinist; an increase from $2.00 to
$2.25 for G. J. Vogel, Assistant Instrument Maker; an increase
from $I.50 to $I.75 for H. L. Ascher, artisan in machine shop.
The total allowance per day for the shops now amounts to $53.50.
These requests increase it to only $54.25, owing to the fact that
some of the employees do not now     receive the full amount
authorized.
The maximum rate previously recommended amounts to $59.75
including the model maker for the ship tank authorized June last,
which is for 19 men.
By granting this maximum rate to be paid in the manner




176


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1907.


indicated, I shall hope to escape the necessity of bringing the
subject to your attention again in the near future.
2. I am also requested to bring to your attention the request
of R. L. Turner, Clerk in the Engineering shops.
Turner was appointed for one year at $4o0 for 12 months. He
has grown to be a valuable clerk and is now worth more. On
account of this, fact, and also because of the general raise in salaries,
I recommend le be now paid $500 for one year.
Respectfully,
M. E. COOLEY.
Regent Barbour moved that the salaries of Professors
V. H. Lane, W. W. Beman, James A. Craig and H. C.

ANN ARBOR, MICH., October I8, 1907.
To the Honorable Board of Regents:
Gentlemen-The dental supply houses which furnish instruments
to the dental students are desirous of securing quarters in the new
Dental Building for. the sale of their goods. We shall have space in
the basement which we shall not need for purposes of instruction
that could readily be adapted to their needs. By building three partition walls and putting in heating, lighting and plumbing four good
rooms can be made which ought to yield rentals of three hundred
dollars each per year. The expense of fitting up the rooms and
maintaining them will not be large, and a good net income is assured.
It is not necessary that this work be done now, as it can wait
until the building is completed, if desirable, except that suitable
provision should be made at this time for the outlets for plumbing
and heating, and another opening for a stairway.
Respectfully submitted,
N. S. HopE,
Acting Dean for the Dental Faculty.

Dear Dr. Angell-In pursuance of my recent conversation with
you, I write you this note to say that I very much desire to visit

the dean's office as pursued in the various universities. I also desire

and administrative principles as pursued in the best institutions in
this country at the present time. You will readily understand that
the sort of information I seek is from its nature more or less confidential, and therefore cannot readily or satisfactorily be obtained
through correspondence. I mentioned this matter to Regent Hill

with them, and in pursuance of that conversation would respectfully
request that I be permitted to visit the larger universities in New
England and the Middle West and devote such time to the study of
these problems as seems best, and that a sum to defray traveling
expenses, not to exceed $300, be allowed for this purpose.
Yours very truly,
JOHN 0. REID.

gentlemen, it is 'not a pleasant thing for me to part company with
this Board and with this University which I love so much. I thank

ANN ARBOR, February 19, I908.
To the Honorable Board of Regents.
Gentlemen-In presenting a budget for the Summer Session of
I908, permit me to call your attention again to the proposition to
extend the summer term from six to eight weeks in the Department
of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and in the Department of
Engineering.
This change is recommended for the following reasons:
i. Because of the resolutions unanimously adopted by the
Literary Faculty and by the Standing Committee of the Department
of Engineering, January 13, favoring such a change.
2. Because of the sentiment prevailing among teachers quite
generally, that the six weeks' term is too short.
3. Because it has been ascertained that three other state universities announce summer sessions longer than six weeks for I908.
The summer session of the Ohio State University will be eight
weeks in length, while at the University of Missouri and the University of Illinois it will be nine weeks in length.

APRIL MEETING, i908.


247


ANN ARBOR, MICH., April 23, 1908.
To the Honorable President and Board of Regents of the University of Michigan:
Gentlemen-A   year ago appropriations were made for two
reprints, for distribution particularly to schools, of valuable papers
presented at the Conferences in connection with the spring meetings of the Michigan Schoolmasters' Club. One was a "Symposium"
on the value of Humanistic Studies as a preparation for the Study
of Law,the other an address by Professor Grandgent, of Harvard
University. The whole amount appropriated was $I77.00, the number of copies of reprints secured was 80oo. There has been a great
demand for the reprints, which are nearly gone. The "Symposium"
reprinted in like manner the previous year has been translated into
German and published, with a complimentary introduction, at
Vienna and Leipzig. As the University has no press of its own, the
purchase of these reprints at cost of presswork, paper and binding answers the purpose of a University publication in the most
economical way; they are mailed as University Bulletins.
This spring there were two groups of papers presented of altogether exceptional interest and value, for which there is an active
demand.   One was on the subject:   "The Doctrine of Formal
Discipline in the Light of Contemporary Psychology," three papers
being presented by Professor James R. Angell, of Chicago, W. B.
Pillsbury, of the University of Michigan, and C. H. Judd, of Yale
University. The other was on the value of humanistic studies as
a preparation for the study of Theology, the two leading addresses
being made by President Mackenzie, of the Hartford Theological
Seminary, and Hugh Black. Reprints of the first can be obtained
from the School Review, of the second from the Educational
Review. We request that an appropriation of $I6o.oo be made to
defray the cost of the two series of reprints. As the matter is in
press, it will be necessary to place the order immediately if the
reprints are to be secured.
Respectfully submitted,

ANN ARBOR, MICH., April 20, 1908.
HON. JAMES B. ANGErL, President Board of Regents:
Sir-I have the honor to inform you that the Faculty of the
Department of Engineering, on April loth, I908, voted to recommend to the Regents for graduation the following candidates:
Harry Lane Dresser, Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering.
Arthur Gustav William Templin, Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.

APRIL MEETING, 1908.


for the Advancement of Teaching, has been sent to President Angell
by Dr. Pritchett:
March 31, 1908.
DR. HERNY S. PRITCHETT, President Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching:
Dearl Si-Your favor of today informs me of the desire of the
professors of State Universities to be embraced in the Pension Fund,
as shown by a resolution unanimously adopted by their National
Association.
In my letter of April I6, I9o5, handing over the Fund to my
Trustees, the following occurs:
'We have, however, to recognize that State and Colonial
Governments which have established or mainly supported Universities, Colleges or Schools may prefer that their relations
shall remain exclusively with the State. I cannot, therefore,
presume to include them.'
I beg now to say that should the Governing Boards of any
State Universities apply for participation in the Fund and the Legislature and Governor of the State approve such application, it will
give me great pleasure to increase the Fund to the extent necessary
to admit them. I understand from you that if all the State Universities should apply and be admitted, Five Millions more of five per
cent. bonds would be required, making the Fund Fifteen Million
Dollars in all.
From the numerous letters I have received from pensioners and
their wives and the warm approval of the press and the public, I
am satisfied that this Fund is, and must be for all time, productive
of lasting good, not only to the recipients, but to the cause of
higher education.
Mlost grateful am I to be privileged as trustee of this wealth to
devote it to such use.
Truly yours,
(Signed)   ANDREW CARNEGIE."
Therefore, Resolved, That the thanks of this Board be tendered
to Mr. Carnegie for his generous act,
Resolved, That this Board respectfully applies for participation
in the Fund,
Resolved further, that this action be made known to the Governor and the Legislature of the State, and their approval of it be
asked.
Dean Hutchins presented a report of the action of the
Law Faculty concerning the requirements for admission to
the Law Department. The paragraph fixing the age for




APRIL MEETING, I908.


251


admission was adopted unanimously, and consideration of
the rest of the report was deferred until the next meeting.
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan:
Geintlemen-At a meeting of the Faculty of the Department of
Law, held January 31, I908, it was unanimously decided that the age
requirements for admission to. the Department should be changed
so as to read as follows:
"Applicants for admission to the first year class of the Department of Law must be at least nineteen years of age; to the second
year class, twenty; and to the third year class, twenty-one. Applicants for admission to the graduate class of said Department and as
special students must be at least twenty-one years of age."
In behalf of the Law Faculty, I respectfully ask that this action
be confirmed by this honorable Board. For the guidance of the
Board, I should state that the present age requirements are as follows: For the first year class, eighteen years; the second year class,
nineteen, and the third year class, twenty, and that the proposed
change would not affect applicants for graduate work or applicants
for admission as special students, as the age requirement now for
such applicants is twenty-one years.
At the same meeting, the following was, after full discussion,
adopted without a dissenting vote:
"In the year I9IO and thereafter, until further notice, an additional year of preparatory work will be required of those who apply
for admission to the Department of Law as candidates for the degree
of Bachelor of Laws. The new requirements may be met by presenting the equivalent of an academical or high-school course of
four years as under the present requirements for admission (see pp.
II-I2 inclusive of the Announcement) and one year of university or
college credit in a university or college approved by the Faculty of
the Department, or by presenting nineteen units of work done in
an approved high school or academy. This work may be selected
from the following subjects or their substantial equivalents: English
Language, English Literature, Foreign Language, History (Ancient,
Mediaeval, Modern, English  and United   States), Mathematics
(Algebra, Plane and Solid Geometry and Trigonometry) and the
following science: Astronomy, Botany, Chemistry, Geology, Physical Geography, Physics and Zoology.
"A unit of work, as the term is here used, is defined as
work in a subject covering a school year of not less than thirty-six
weeks with at least five recitation periods each week. Unider the
new requirements, then, the additional year of preparatory work




252


APRIL MEETING, I908.


may be taken in an approved university or college, and this the
Faculty advises whenever it is practicable for the student so to do,
or in an approved academy or high school that offers the requisite
facilities. Certificates will be received, as at present, in lieu of
examinations, provided they come from approved universities, colleges, academies, or high schools, and contain, in addition to a
recommendation for admission to the Department, derailed statements showing the length of the time each subject has been pursued
and that the standing of the applicant has been satisfactory. Blank
certificates, of the form desired, will be furnished upon application
to the Secretary of the Department."
"To meet the case of nature students who, although lacking the
technical preparation required for admission as candidates for the
degree, are, by reason of natural gifts, previous training or experience in practical affairs, specially fitted for the study and practice
of the law, the Faculty will, upon special application, permit an
applicant, who comes within the class described, and who has
attended the Department for a period of two years as a special
student, to become a candidate for the degree without the technical
preparatory training hereinbefore described, but only when such
applicant has maintained throughout his two years of residence a
record of exceptional excellence in all the subjects pursued.  It
should be understood that this privilege will be confined strictly
within the provisions herein set forth."
In behalf of the Law   Faculty, I respectfully ask that this
action be confirmed by this honorable Board, and that the increased
requirements, as above set forth, be authorized.
* * * *
That the members of the Board may understand fully the reasons for the changes that they are asked to authorize*and the results
that may probably be expected to follow such changes, I submit,
with the approval of the Law Faculty, the following statement:
I should suggest first, that the conclusion of the Faculty in
regard to the matter in issue was a deliberate one, reached only
after a most careful and thorough consideration of the whole subject of preparatory training for the study of the law and with full
knowledge of the experience of law   schools that have already
increased their preparatory requirements by the addition of one or
more years of college or university work. In their deliberations
the members were aided materially by an exhaustive compilation of
facts relating to legal education in the United States, made by Professotr Wilgus, the chairman of a special committee appointed by
the Dean of 'the Department several months ago to examine and
report upon the subject of increased requirements for admission.




APRIL MEETING, I908.


253


A copy of this compilation is in the hands of the chairman of the
Law Committee of your Board. An examination of it reveals at
once the fact that it is a distinct contribution to the history of
legal education.
Briefly stated, the reasons for the changes proposed are: First,
that in the judgment of the Faculty, the average high-school graduate has but an indifferent equipment for legal study, particularly
if he goes at once from the high school to the law school without
an intervening period of study or of business training, and, secondly,
that the best law schools of the country, including several of our
neighboring state university schools, are requiring, or are about to
require, one or more years of university or college training of candidates for the law degree.
It goes without saying, of course, that some men are fitted by
nature for the study and practice of the law, and that with such
men the matter of preliminary training is of minor importance. The
intellectual grasp and the attendant power of lucid- and logical
statement that thorough and' systematic and extended preliminary
training is supposed to give, are with such men natural endowments.
And so it is that not infrequently we find among the best men in
our law classes some who have come to us directly from the high
school. Furthermore, even the high school graduate of moderate
ability, whose training has been of the rigorous kind and who comes
to his law studies with habits of industry and with an earnest purpose to make the most of his opportunities, may, and he often does,
outrank the indifferent college graduate. But cases like the foregoing are exceptional. It is a fact, and it is one that is constantly
brought to the attention of the law teacher, that, as a rule, the
strongest students in law are those who have had more than the
high school training. It stands to reason that this should be so.
The law is an intensely intellectual profession, and the successful
study of our jurisprudence requires the mastery and control of
one's intellectual processes and the development of one's reasoning
faculties to a degree that is ordinarily attained only after long and
systematic disciplinary study. The person who 'attempts the work
with an indifferent preliminary training must find himself constantly
handicapped. The training of a complete undergraduate course is
none too much. But while the Faculty feel this to be so, they are of
the opinion that such a requirement, at the present time, and under
existing conditions, would be premature and unwise.  They are
very confident, however, that the time has come for the first step
in that direction, and therefore they report for your approval the
action hereinbefore set forth.




254


APRIL MEETING, 1908.


That the law schools of several other universities, and particularly of some of our neigboring state universities, are requiring
additional preparatory work of the college grade, is a significant
fact that we cannot disregard.  Illinois, Minnesota, Texas and
Washington State Universities, either now require, or will in 1909,
one year of college work of those who apply for admission as candidates for the law'degree. Two years of college work are now
required of candidates for the law degree by the Ohio State University, Trinity College, N. C., the University of North Carolina,
the University of West Virginia and the University of Wisconsin,
and in I909 Yale, Boston and George Washington Universities will
require the same. Harvard, Stanford, Chicago, the Catholic University of America, Columbia, New York University, and California
now require four years of college work for admission to their law
courses as candidates for their degrees or make a distinction in the
degrees granted to graduates and to non-graduates. While the
work of our Law Department is undoubtedly as strenuous as that
of any law school in the country, and while the standard of legal
scholarship that the student must reach and maintain in order to
pass the examinations of the Department, is probably quite as
high as that of any other school, it is nevertheless true, as is
apparent from the above showing, that we are materially behind
many of the schools in this matter of preliminary requirements.
In view of what her neighbors are doing and of her recognized
policy of leadership, can Michigan afford to run the risk of putting
her Law Department among schools of the second rank by neglecting to take the suggested step in advance?
I beg to call the attention of the Board to the fact that the
authorizing of the suggested additional requirements will.be simply
another step in the carrying out of a policy that was inaugurated
at the time of the reorganization of the Department thirteen years
ago, namely, to add to the quantity and improve the quality of the
work required for graduation and to increase gradually the requirements for admission. In pursuance of this policy the course of
study in I895 was extended to three years and additional entrance
requirements were announced to go into effect in 1897. The subjects
added by this action were algebra to quadratics, plane geometry,
general history and civil government. In I898 it was announced
that in September, 900o, and thereafter, until further notice, all
applicants. for admission to the Department, if candidates for the
degree, must have a preliminary education equivalent to that required
for admission to the Department of Literature, Science, and the
Arts. Tlhis resulted in the addition of two years of foreign language, two sciences and quadratics, and made the requirements for




APRIL MEETING, 9o8.                      255
admission a high-school course of four years, or its equivalent, and
this has continued to be the requirement for the past seven years.
Not only have the requirements for admission been gradually
increased as indicated, but since the course was extended to three
years the standard of scholarship in the Department has been
materially advanced.
It should be noted, moreover, that the additional requirements
asked, are of a kind that in many communities may be secured in
the high school; that special students are to be received, as is the
case at present, without examination, provided they are twenty-one
years of age and can satisfy the Dean that they are qualified to
carry law work, and that the special student of exceptional ability
and industry may, by permission of the Faculty, secure the degree,
even though lacking the technical preparation prescribed. It cannot,
therefore, be said that by the conditions.imposed none can enter the
Department excepting those who are able to take a year of preparatory work at some university or college, or that the doors of the
Department will be closed to, the worthy and industrious student
who cannot secure a through' preparatory training.
While the Faculty strenuously urge affirmative action in regard
to the matters hereinbefore set forth, they feel that the members of
the Board before acting should understand fully the probable results
if the proposed changes are made. And they beg to suggest first,
that one result will undoubtedly be a marked general improvement
in the equipment of. the students who come to us. The preparation
of the students as a whole for the difficult work of the course will
certainly be of a higher grade and more nearly the same, and thus
the embarrassment that must always eixst in teaching classes made
up of those whose preliminary training has been unequal in amount
and quality will in a measure disappear.
But while a noticeable advance in the training of the general
student body and in the character of the work that can be accomplished, may be expected from the measure proposed, it will, if
adopted, undoubtedly result in a material falling off in attendance.
Judging from the experience of other schools in this regard 'and
from the general situation that confronts us, the writer is of the
opinion that we must expect, if we take this step, a decrease of
from twenty to thirty per cent. in our numbers, and he is inclined
to think that the latter per cent. will be found to be the more nearly
correct and further that the loss will be a permanent one. But it
should be said in this connection that many, and probably a majority, of the Law Faculty feel that the per cent. that he suggests is
too large and that we would soon recover from any loss in numbers
that we might suffer through the change. There are some facts,




256              APRIL MEETING, 1908.
however, that bear significantly upon the situation and that probably
tend to support the judgment of the writer. So far as the experi-.
ment of imposing college or university work as a condition for
admission to law schools has been tried, it has, with a single exception, resulted in a material falling off in attendance, and as yet,
with a single exception, there has been little if any increase in numbers under the new regime. The exception to which reference is
made is Harvard, but this can hardly be regarded as an exception,
as the most of the students in attendance there when the change
was made, were college graduates, so, that the requiring of a college
degree would. naturally affect attendance but little. The loss at
Columbia, where similar action was taken, was thirty per cent., and
as yet it has not been made good. The experience in Wisconsin,
where two years of college work are now required, has thus far
been substantially the same as at Columbia, although the Dean of
the Law  School there expresses the belief that the school will
eventually reach its former numbers. There is, of course, force in
the suggestion that may be made, that in those schools that have
increased their requirements by adding college work, the change
is of so recent a date that it is too early to predict as to what will
be the permanent effect upon attendance.
The general law school situation is such that in the judgment
of the writer, we must expect a material falling off in attendance
with increased requirements of the college grade. The number who
seek the path of least resistance is always large, and there are
many who have neither the time nor money for extended preparatory
work. These will naturally drift to the numerous schools on every
side of us whose entrance requirements are less exacting than are
ours. We must not lose sight of the opportunities for law study
that are now offered within the territory from' which we draw
the majority of our students.  In I86o, there were within that
territory three law schools, in I870, seven, in I88o, thirteen, in I890,
twenty, and in I907, forty-seven. It is a matter of surprise to those
understanding the competition that we are obliged to, meet, thiat
our attendance, even under present conditions, is so large. And
when we call to mind that a majority of these schools exact simply
a high school preparation and will probably for some time to come
and that some require even less, it will be quite apparent that the
-prospective law student, with limited preparation, will find little
difficulty in selecting a school whose requirements he can easily
meet. Moreover, we must-reckon with the correspondence schools
that are each year becoming more numerous, and we must not lose
sight of the fact that there is-an easy road to the bar through the
law office and the state examining board. The law schools are dif



APRIL MEETING, I908.


257


ferently situated from  the medical schools. In practically every
state at the present time. before one can be admitted to an examination for a license to practice medicine, he must show to the examining board that he has been graduated from some reputable medical
college, while graduation from a law school is not a prerequisite to
an examination for admission to the bar in any state. The.medical
schools, therefore, are a necessary part of the legal machinery governing admission to the practice of medicine, but the law schools
are not a necessary part of the machinery governing admission to
the bar. The medical schools may advance their standards and
students must meet the advance or stay out of the profession, but
no such result follows the raising of law school standards, for the
way to the bar through Ithe office and examining board remains
open. As a matter of fact the leading law schools of the country
are,. in their standards, very much in advance of the profession
and the examining boards. It is not an unusual occurrence for
a student who, has been dropped from this Department to pass the
tests of a state examining board very soon thereafter and without
an opportunity for further preparation. Until the profession generally can be induced to secure a change in the laws so that our
state examining boards must advance their requirements both preliminary and professional until they are equal to those of our leading schools, such schools must necessarily suffer a falling off in
attendance whenever a step in. advance is made.
But notwithstanding the fact that we must expect a very
material decrease in our numbers, if the suggested changes are
made, there should not in our judgment be any hesitation on the
part of this Board in authorizing the changes proposed. We must
take the step or become a second-class school and a. dumping
ground, so to speak, for poorly prepared students who cannot enter
schools of the first grade. The movement for increased preliminary requirements is a movement that we must ultimately join and
the longer we delay the more difficult will become the adjustment.
The school making the higher requirement will naturally attract
the better prepared students.  We hope the time has not come
and that it will never come when the authorities of this University will feel that they must sacrifice high standards to mere numbers.  Seven years have passed since the last advance in our
entrance requirements, and if the policy that was declared by this
Board at the time of the reorganization of the Department thirteen
years' ago is to be carried out, it is high time that the next step,
which is the one proposed, should be taken. It should be noted
that the movement is in the direction of what according to the
general consensus of opinion among the teachers in professional




258


APRIL MEETING, I908.


schools should be the minimum preparation for professional study,
namely, a college or university course of at least two. years.
I beg to suggest in closing that the large numbers in this
Department have for years been a serious embarrassment.  The
old method of teaching by lecture is no longer followed in this or
any other first-class school.  The purpose of the modern law
teacher is to instruct the student in legal reasoning as well as in
legal principles, and this can be accomplished only by close personal work with individual students.  With our large sections,
which the limited number in our Faculty makes necessary, students
feel and rightly feel that they do not receive the personal attention to which they are entitled. It is well known that students
have not infrequently chosen other and smaller schools in order
that they might have the individual attention that the teacher
with smaller sections can give. With our present teaching force,
the school ought not to number more than five hundred students.
We respectfully ask that this communication may be made a
part of the records of this Board.

JUVNE 5 MEETING, 1908.

ANN ARBOR, MIICH., May 2I, I938.
DE;AN J. O. REED, University of, Michigan:
Dear Mr. Reed —In accordance with our recent conversation, I
hand you herewith two papers:
I. Old form of contract with the Macmillan Company for the
publication of a volume of University of Michigan Studies, accormpanied by a letter of the president of the Company, dated October
IT, I907.
2. New form of contract which has been accepted by the Macmillan Company to cover future volumes, including those published
at the expense of Mr. Charles L. Freer, and such others as it may
seem best to publish in the same series.
I do not take the time to comment upon the differences in these
contracts. In view of the value of the circulation of the Macmillan
catalogues in all parts of the English-speaking world and of the
standing of this firm as publishers of works of scholarship, the
terms of the new contract seem to mne the most favorablle that we
could hope to obtain. This contract in no way commits the University financially; I am glad to assume the financial responsibility,
being in turn guaranteed for the Freer volumes by the contract already
executed, which was placed in your hands a month ago, and for the
other volumes by pledges or appropriations already nmade.
Sincerely yours,
FRANCIS W. KEILSEY.
THE NEW CONTRACT.
The contracts heretofore made between The Macmillan Company and Francis W. Kelsey for the publication of The University
of Michigan Studies-Humanistic Series-having proved unsatisfactory, they are hereby terminated and both parties are released from
the details and requiremenrts therein contained.
As it is desired that the connection with the publishing company shall be continued, at least nominally, for this series of Studies,
it is now agreed between The Macmillan Company and Francis W.
Kelsey as follows:
I. That the Macmillan Company shall no longer handle the
stock of the Studies, nor be responsible for its manufacture, nor pay
any bills in relation to the publication of the Studies, The Macmillan
Company becoming the publishers of the Studies in name only, under
the following conditicns:
(a) That The Macmillan Company shall forward to the Librarian of the University of Michigan any orders received by it for
volumes of the aforesaid Studies, accompanying these orders with
cash whenever it receives cash in payment; and,




272


JUNE 5 MEETING, 90o8.


(b) That The Mlacmillan Company shall include the titles of
the several volumes of Studies in; its general catalogues as issued, in
order that intending subscribers and others may know that orders
for them  may be forwarded to 'The Macmillan Company for
execution.
2. In return for the advertising of the Studies by The Macmillan Company in its catalogues in the malnler proposed, Francis
W. Kelsey agrees to print the imprint of The Macmillan Company
on the title page and outside cover of each volume of the Studies
as its publishers. He also agrees to print, without charge to the
Macmillan Company, except in exchange for the advertising as stated
above, two pages of advertisements of The Macmillan Company's
books in each volume issued.
3. The Macmillan Company shall not carry in stock the volumes of the Studies or be responsible for their appearance or supply
in any way, the present stock of the Studies now in The Macmillan
Company's hands, if any, to be' shipped, as may be directed by
Francis W. Kelsey, on the signing of this agreement.

JUNE 5 MEETING, I908.


275


myself at our house last evening by Dean Cooley, Professor Davis,
and yourself, and that in, your opinion we have lands possessing
all these requiremcnts, and the further examination of those lands
today proving, as your Committee tells me, that said lands are
exceptionally well adapted-in fact, as they say, "ideal for purposes
needed by the University;" and realizing that bencfits to these
young people will be of lasting value to themselves, to this and to
the other states and countries they represent, and that the "cheris-hed hopes" of your Committee may be realized for the acquirement
of about fourteen hundred acres, mapped by them today, as their
desideratum, and that the good work you contemplate may begin
at once with ample grounds, therefore, Mrs. Bogardus and myself
will accept your appropriation of Twenty-five H1undred Dollars in
part payment, and it gives us great pleasure to ask you to kindly
accept from us, as a gift to the University, the difference between
the Twenty-five Hundred Dollars and the real value of this property..You insisted that a value should be placed upon the property,
which we much dislike to do, it being largely a gift. However, we
should think approximately Twenty-five Thousand Dollars would
be a low value for it; a part of it would not be priced or disposed
of at all for other purposes.
We enclose warranty deed in accordance with the foregoing,
and with our best wishes for the continued success of your institution, and the success of this new feature, we are,
Very sincerely yours,
CHAS. EOCARDUS,
HANNAHI W. EOGARDUS.

of the Board.
DIED, at Detroit, on Saturday, June the 6th, I908, aged seventy-eight, PETER WHITE, our colleague and our much loved friend.
In the fullness of years, with mind still active along the entire
range of enterprise with which he was concerned, with heart still
warm with every noble sympathy, and with hand wide open to give
bounty to every person and every cause in need, he was suddenly
called. He who sat with us less than a fortnight ago now rests in
the beautiful cemetery forever by the side of his wife and kindred
in the city of his home. Of him it can be as truly said as of
any man:
"None knew him but to love him;
None named him but to praise."
He had the port and presence of a man, a nature genial, pervasive, winning, a mind and hand for large affairs. His name is
written in the annals of the state where he discharged large public
functions. His broad aims and purposes are built into the structure
of which he was one of the great architects. The purpose of his
life was to make the world better. Education, religion, patriotism,
philanthrophy-all these he served, the law of service being the
elemental constitution of his nature.
While we mourn his loss, we feel pride and satisfaction in that
he lived to fill the measure of a noble manhood. And when that
Memorial Temple, of which the corner stone shall be laid to-day, is
finished, high among the names to be inscribed upon its walls will
be that of our friend, of the friend of the University, who wrought
for her to his last day on earth —PTErR WHIT1E.
On motion of Regent Hill, the following two schemes
of study in the Department of Engineering, one for a four
years' course and the other for a six years' course, were
unanimously adopted.

ANN ARBOR, May 23, I9o8.
HON. JAMES B. ANGEIL,
President of the Board of Regents.
Sir-I have the honor to transmit herewith the recommendations of the Faculty of the Department of Engineering relative to
the Six-Year Courses of Study, which it is desired to establish in
this Department, in addition to the present four-year courses of
study.
This action is based on the unprecedented advance in engineering during the past decade and the great demand for graduates
from our engineering schools to engage in a wide variety of work
and the general awakening to the necessity of giving closer attention to those subjects of vital interest to the public coming within
the sphere of the engineer's work-all of which has forced upon all
engineering schools the question of a broader training for their
graduates.
For several years the Department of Engineering at this University has been working on a longer course of study with a view
to its inauguration when the time should be ripe for it. That time
is believed to have arrived. The details of the proposed courses of
study have been very carefully considered by the Standing Committee of the Department, particularly during the past few months,
including the necessarily more intimate relations with the Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
The Faculty, at its meeting May 13, appointed a committee to
confer with a similar committee from the Department of Literature,




JUNE MEETING, 1908.


305


Science, and the Arts on the proposed six-year course and the degree
to be conferred therefor. At a meeting of this joint committee on
May I9 the entire subject was considered, with no differences of
opinion except on degrees. In this matter the Department of Engineering has. acceded to the wishes of the Department of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, as expressed by its Committee.
Following this joint conference, the Standing Committee of this
Department submitted its report to the Faculty, which, after due
deliberation, voted to adopt the report and the proposed plan of
study and to recommend the same to the Regents for their approval.
The recommendations of the Faculty are as follows:
I. That the Six-Year Course, as outlined, be authorized and
approved, the courses of study to be announced in the forthcoming Bulletin of the Department, and students to be received in the
Six-Year Course, beginning with the next college year.

Regent Carey introduced the following resolution, which
was adopted:
Resolved, That Mr. Simonds be requested to lay out a drive 30
ft. wide on the Observatory grounds around the north side of what
is known as "Sleepy Hollow," with the idea of deeding the same to
the city if the part of Huron St. east of Fourteenth St. is vacated.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, the Committee on Buildings and Grounds was, by the full vote of the Board, given
authority to purchase materials to be used in the construction of the addition to the Observatory.
On motion of Regent Knappen, Miss Bertha Stuart,
M.D., was appointed Director of the Barbour Gymnasium

for one year at the salary of $900, by the full vote of the
Board.
On motion of Regent Hill, the salary of Junior Professor
Cross was raised to $2,200.
On motion of Regent Carey, the budget, which had been
considered at the various periods during the two days' session, the details having been informally adopted, was now
adopted as a whole by the full vote of the Board.      The
budget is printed at the end of this record.
On motion of Regent Carey, the Finance Committee
were instructed to consult with Professor Adams with the
view of revising our system of university accounts, including
the books of the Secretary's office and the auditing of. the
same.
The following communication from the Director of the
Waterman Gymnasium was received and placed on file:
To the Honorable, the Board of Regents.
Gentlemen-I have very carefully read the petition of the
Fencers' Club referred to me by the Board. The Fencers' Club has
been given the use three days each week of one of the two rooms
in the gymnasium used for the different clubs and teams. A few
years ago there was considerable friction as to who had the right
to use the rooms, so I found it necessary to arrange a schedule of
days for the different clubs and teams. It has never been understood that any club or team had exclusive use of any room in the
gymnasium, as it is the aim of this department to use the rooms
we have to the best advantage of all taking work in the gymnasium.
I do not think it advisable to appoint instructors for the clubs
and teams that spring up from year to year, as there are several of
these clubs with an average membership of from twenty-five to
thirty students.                  Respectfully yours,
KEENE. FITZPATRICK.
On motion of Regent Fletcher, the Executive Committee
was authorized to pass upon the appointments in the' Literary
Department, the scheme for which was in the hands of the
chairman of the Committee on the Literary Department.
This action was taken by the full vote of the Board.
On motion of Regent Knappen, the Board unanimously
voted to establish in the Department of Law the degree of
Juris Doctor (J.D.), said degree to be conferred upon such




812            JUNE MEETING, 1908.
graduates of approved universities and colleges as complete
the full three years law course in said Department and are
recommended therefor by the Faculty of said Department.
On the recommendation of Professor F. N. Scott, it was
voted that leave of absence for the coming year be granted
to Mr. C. B. Morrill, instructor in Rhetoric, on account of
his impaired health.
The Board then adjourned to July I4th, at Io o'clock,
A. M.
JAMES B. ANGELL,
for Secretary.




THE BUDGET OF g908-9.
We give herewith the Budget in two forms, first, for convenience of comparison, a summary of the appropriations of
I907-8 and of 90o8-9; second, a statement by Departments
of increases of salary and promotions affecting the pay-roll
for I908-9, and of increased allowances for equipment and
incidental expenses.
Following these is a statement of the Estimated Income
for I908-9.

upon the Combined Literary and Medical Course, involving as it
does 'certain modifications: in our present practice. Th!is report has
been unanimously adopted by the Faculties of both the Department

To the Honorable, the Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan.
Gentlemen-Without adding to the total expenditure already
authorized for the Summer Session, of I908, I respectfully request
your approval of the following changes, made necessary by the
demands of the situation:
I. The cancellation of one instructorship in the Department of
Engineering at a salary of $288.
2. The appointment of Mr. J: E. Emswiler as instructor in
Mechanical Engineering for half time at half pay, i. e.,.$I44.
3. The appointment of Dr. C. E. Eggert as instructor in German
for two courses rather than for one, making his salary $I92 in place
of.$96.
4. The appointment of Mr. Leo Thomas as assistant in Botany
at a salary of $50
5. The appointment of Mr. J. E. Harris as assistant to Dr.
Gomberg at a salary of $35.
These changes involve a sum which exceeds the amount of the
cancelled instructorship by only $37, and this sum can be taken
from the amount authorized for assistants in Surveying, which will
not be entirely expended.
I may add that the summer enrollment has; already gone beyond
I,07o, which was the total for last year, and will' probably come
close to I,Ioo. There is a falling off in the Department of M.edicine and Surgery of about 20 per cent.; Engineering and Law are

SEPTEMBER MEETING
LUNIVERSITY O M/ICHIGAN, 
ANN ARBOR, September 24, 1908.
The Board met in the Regents' room at Io o'clock A. M.
Present, Regents Carey, Fletcher, Osborn, Sawyer, Beal and
Leland; absent, Regents Knappen and Hill.
Regent Fletcher was excused in order that he might open
and tabulate the bids for the proposed Chemical Laboratory
and the Engineering Building.
The proceedings were read by the President, and on
motion of Regent Sawyer were approved.
The President called Regent Leland to the chair and
then presented his Annual Report, which was as follows.
PRESIDENT'S REPORT,
To the Regents of the University:I beg to present my Annual Report for the year ending
September 24, 1908.
It is with deep regret that I am called to begin this
Report with recording the death of Regent Peter White
on June 6th. He had sat with the Board on the previous
day. While walking on the street in Detroit he was seized
with mortal illness and expired in a few minutes. Heb had
served on the Board since January I, I905. In meeting his
duties as Regent as in all his public service he was scrupulously. faithful. He had played an important part in the
history of the State, especially in the development of the
Upper Peninsula. He was a man of unbounded generosity.
The University has repeatedly been the recipient of his
bounties, particularly in supporting scholarships and fellowships and in contributing to funds for purchasing rare books
and for issuing special publications. One of his last acts on
the day before he died was to make a generous contribution
to the fund for the purchase of an athletic field for the use




338


SEPTEMIBER MIEETING, i908.


of our women students. Perhaps no citizen of our State
was more widely known or more generally esteemed.
At the close of the last calendar year the term of service
of Regent Henry S. Dean and of Regent Levi L. Barbour
expired. As their successors, Junlus E. Beal and Frank
B. Leland took their seats in January. At the July meeting, Chase S. Osborn, who had been appointed to succeed
Regent White, took his seat.
On December 15, 1907, the Board accepted the resignation of Harrison Soule, Treasurer, to take effect February
I, I908, and on Mlay 22, 1908, the resignation of Janes H.
Wade, Secretary. These officers entered upon their duties
at the same time, and had served the University for nearly
a quarter of a century. By their unremitting toil and their
devotion to the interests of the University, they had retained
the confidence of all the members who have in the last
twenty-five years held seats on this Board, and won the
respect and esteem of the great body of Professors and the
thousands of students who have been brought into relations
with them.
George S. Baker, who had for some time held a responsible position in the Treasurer's office, was appointed by
you to succeed Treasurer Soule, and Shirley W. Smith, to
succeed Secretary Wade.  Mr. Smith, a graduate of the
Literary Department, having been an instructor in English
for three years and also editor of the Alumnus, is familiar
with the interior life of the University. The knowledge
thus gained and his experience during the last few years in
business life in Philadelphia serve to prepare him, it is believed, for the varied duties of the important office to which
he is called.
George Dock, M.D., Sc.D., who has with distinction
held a Professorship in the Department of Medicine and
Surgery since I891, has during the vacation resigned his
Chair of Medicine and Clinical Medicine to accept an important position in New Orleans. The vacancy will soon
be filled.
Instructor John W. Bradshaw has resigned the office of
Registrar of the Literary Department in order to give his




SEPTEMBER MEETING, i908.


339


full time to the work of teaching. His successor as Registrar
is Professor Arthur G. Hall, whom we have called back
from his position as Professor of Mathematics in Miami
University. Mr. Hall, who graduated here in 1887, was
formerly a member of our Literary Faculty. While he will
do a limited amount of teaching, he will add to the duties of
Registrar those of editor of our Calendar and other official
publications.
Professor J. B. Davis has resigned his office of Associate
Dean of the Engineering Department in order to give more
of his time to the work of instruction. Junior Professor
W. H. Butts succeeds him in the position of Assistant Dean,
which has become an office of much importance, since the
number of engineering students has become so great.
Mr. C. G. Wrentmore, Junior Professor of Civil Engineering, has obtained leave of absence for the coming year
to accept the position of Assistant Director of Public Works
in the Philippine Islands. He is so, well fitted for that place
that we are confident he will discharge the duties incumbent
on him in a manner useful to his country and creditable
both to himself and to us.
The University Senate has been impressed with the conviction that the Thanksgiving recess and the Christmas recess are too long and have been so appointed that a considerable infringement on the time allotted for-work has
ensued. With your approval they have therefore abridged
them and in such a manner that they hope punctuality in
'attendance may be secured. They have also fixed the spring
recess at a date which divides the second semester into two
equal parts. They have placed the annual Commencement
and the beginning of the academic year a week later than
they have come in recent years.  It is thought that the
change in the date of Commencement will secure a larger
attendance on that festival. It is believed that for climatic
reasons it is better to postpone the opening of work from
September to an early date in October.
Owing to the introduction from time to time by the
Regents of new titles for members of the Faculties, it has
been deemed wise to make a new statute, determining the




340


SEPTEMBER M;IEETING, 1908.


composition of the University Senate.  By that statute
that body is now to be composed of the President of the
University, the Professors, the Associate Professors, the
Junior Professors, the Assistant Professors, and the Acting
Professors of all Departments, the Librarian, and others of
equivalent rank. The Senate is authorized to consider any
subject pertaining to the interests of the University and to
make recommendations to the Regents in regard thereto.
Since the Senate is so large a body that it is not convenient for it to assemble frequently, the Senate Council,
consisting of the President and of the Dean and two members of the Literary Faculty, one member of each other Faculty, meets monthly and considers questions to be laid
before the Senate or the Regents, and may act for the Senate
in vacation periods. The Council has proved to be a useful
organization.
After. careful consideration it was decided this year to
lengthen the session of the Summer School from six weeks
to eight weeks. A large number of the students last year
requested this action. They believed it would enable them
to do more satisfactory work, and they welcomed the opportunity to get larger credits towards graduation, in case they
could at a later date become regular students.  As the
expense of conducting the school for a longer term was
necessarily increased, it was thought necessary to raise the
fee from fifteen dollars to! twenty dollars.  Some doubt
was expressed whether these changes would not reduce the
attendance. The doubt, however, proved groundless. The
attendance was about thirty larger than on the previous
year. The number of graduate students, and of other mature
students, such as principals and superintendents of schools,
was especially increased. The testimony of the Professors
is uniform that the work done in the Summer School is on
the whole more earnest and fruitful than that done in the
regular academic term. The great body of the summer
students come for a definite purpose, and knowing that
they have a limited time to accomplish it, they improve to
the utmost their opportunities.
We have found that not a few of the persons attracted

to our Summer Session became desirous of matriculating
with the hope in due time of graduating. By way of
encouraging them to do so, the Board have provided that
one who pays twenty-five dollars is regarded as having paid
both the matriculation fee and the regular fee for the Summer Session, and is thus started on the road toward graduation.
I am gratified to say that in the past year the largest
portion of the increase in attendance is found in the Literary
Department. In these days when not a few men in eminent
educational positions are advocating very radical measures
in what they call vocational education, involving very narrow special training even from early school days for some
particular pursuit, I deem it encouraging to see among
our constituency a desire for a sound, well-balanced, allround training, which shall fit men for taking up later an
effective special preparation for any one of the several pursuits. A very large proportion of American students do
not know in their early years what particular calling they
are to follow. One of the valuable features of a college
life is to reveal to them what vocation it will be best for
them to choose. And even if they do know at the time to
begin college life what is to be their calling, the wise thing
is for them to lay some broad foundation for their professional studies in wisely-chosen courses in the Literary Department. I may add that the Faculties of all our Professional Schools, including the Engineering School, would
much prefer that their students should come to them after
having completed a part or the whole of the Literary
curriculum. It is to be borne in mind that in I9IO the candidates for graduation in the Department of Medicine and
Surgery will before entrance be required to have completed
two years' work in our Literary Department or to have done
an equivalent amount of collegiate work in some reputable
college.
The Engineering Faculty have with much pains marked
out a six-year course, by the completion of which their students will secure a broader foundation of general culture
and larger attainments in their technical studies. In the

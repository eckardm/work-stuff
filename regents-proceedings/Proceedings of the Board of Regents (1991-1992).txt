JULY MEETING, 1991


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, July 18, 1991
The Regents met at 1:00 PM. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, and Varner.
Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice Presidents
Cosovich, Johnson, Kelly, Swain, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones and Wilson. Regent Waters arrived at about 1:25 P.M.; Regent
Baker arrived at 1:55 P.M.
Further Diversification of Endowment Assets; Common Stock Management of
University Endowment Fund; Alternative Fixed Income Investments
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Womack to introduce the discussion of proposed modifications to investments and management of the University Endowment Fund. Vice President Womack introduced Mr. David
Thurston of Cambridge Associates, the University's investment consultant.
Mr. Thurston explained that the action requests are a continuation of the
strategies that the Regents had adopted previously. He distributed a handout
summarizing these goals as maintaining a high equity exposure of 70 percent, diversifying into alternative equity assets (10 percent real estate, 5 percent venture
capital, and 5 percent oil and gas), averaging into alternative equity assets, and
hedging the common stock portfolio with a strategic asset allocation program
which will be discontinued when the endowment is more diversified in both
equity assets and common stock.
Mr. Thurston noted that the current commitment to venture capital is 1.1
percent. The recommended investment of $5 million in Advent Atlantic and Pacific II will increase the venture capital commitment to 2.0 percent.
Consistent with the endowment strategy of maintaining the "value" emphasis
and replacing underperforming managers, the next recommendation was the appointment of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. (GMO) as a common stock
manager. Mr. Thurston displayed analyses showing that GMO had outperformed
Fidelity Management Trust Company over a ten-year period with an equivalent
risk. He pointed out that other common stock management goals of maintaining
a small capitalization emphasis and diversifying by averaging into foreign stocks
were underway, while adding growth stocks had not yet occurred.
Mr. Thurston noted that Regent Smith had suggested that fixed income investments might be another focus of the investment strategy, and that he agreed
that this was a sound idea. The recommended method to start this strategy is to
expand the 2.5 percent alternative fixed income investments to 5.0 percent and to
commit $3 million to WHR Workout Fund II, managed by Whitman, Heffernan
& Rhein.
Further Diversification of Endowment Assets. Following some discussion,
Regent Varner moved that $5 million be committed to Advent Atlantic and
Pacific II (venture capital fund). Regent Nielsen seconded the motion, and it was

Regent Smith abstaining. Regents Waters and Baker were absent.
Common Stock Management of the University Endowment Fund. On a
motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents unanimously
approved the appointment of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. as an
investment manager for the University Endowment Fund.
Alternative Fixed Income Investments. Regent Nielsen moved, Regent
Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved the following: that the
0.0 - 2.5 percent allocation to reorganization investments be increased and
broadened to a 0.0 - 5.0 percent allocation to alternative fixed income investments, and that $3 million be committed to the WHR Workout Fund II.

Vice President Womack announced that Merrill Lynch & Company had submitted the low bid to purchase the Engineering College Projects Student Fee
Bonds, Series 1991.
Regent Waters arrived at the meeting at 1:25 P.M.
Following some discussion, Regent McFee moved that the Regents adopt
and incorporate into the minutes of this meeting the resolution which authorizes
the issuance, sale, and delivery of the $8,100,000 Engineering Projects Student
Fee Bonds, Series 1991, to Merrill Lynch. Regent Nielsen seconded the motion,
and it was adopted unanimously. The text of the resolution can be found in the

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Nielsen, the Regents
unanimously adopted the following retirement memoirs:
Mathew Alpern, professor of physiological optics in the Departments of Ophthalmology and Physiology in the Medical School, and professor of psychology in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from    active faculty
status on June 30, 1991.
Born and raised in Akron, Ohio, Professor Alpern earned his O.D. degree in
1941 from Northern Illinois College of Optometry. After spending a brief period
of time in private optometry practice, he joined the U.S. Army, serving from
1942-46. He received his B.M.E. degree from the University of Florida in 1944,


-10 -



July Meeting 191


and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physiological optics from The Ohio State University in 1948 and 1950, respectively.
Having worked prodigiously for nearly 50 years in the field of visual science,
Professor Alpern began his academic career in 1951 as an assistant professor of
optometry at Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1955 as an instructor in ophthalmology and research
associate in the Vision Research Laboratory. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1956 and associate professor in 1958. He received additional appointments as associate professor of psychology in 1959 and associate professor of
physiology in 1960. In 1963, he was promoted to his present positions as professor of physiological optics in the Departments of Ophthalmology and Physiology
and professor of psychology in the Department of Psychology. A gifted scientist
and educator, Professor Alpern is one of the world's foremost experts on color
vision. He has made significant contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms of vision and his work has had, and will continue to have, a major impact
on vision research.
Over the years, Professor Alpern has received numerous awards, including
the Jonas Stein Friedenwald Award from the Association for Research in Vision
and Ophthalmology, the Edgar D. Tillyer Medal of the Optical Society of America, the Research to Prevent Blindness Senior Scientific Investigator Award, the
Charles F. Prentice Medal, and an Honorary Doctor of Science degree from the
State University of New York, College of Optometry, Manhattan. In 1991, Professor Alpern was elected to the  ational Academy of Sciences. He has just
completed his retirement furlough at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in
H ia, Israel.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar, educator, and researcher
for his dedicated service by naming Mathew Alpern Professor Emeritus of Physiological Optics and Professor Emeritus of Psychology.
Samuel H. Barnes, professor of political science in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts and research scientist in the Center for Political Studies, Institute for Social Research, retired from active faculty status on June 30, 1991,
after a career of scholarship and teaching at the University of Michigan that has
lasted 34 years.
A native of Mississippi, Professor Barnes received his B.A. and M.A. degrees
from Tulane University min 1952 and 1954, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from
Duke University in 1957. He has held visiting appointments at the Umniversity of
Florence, the University of Rome, and the University of Calabria. He was a
fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and a visiting
scholar at the Hoover Institution.
Professor Barnes came to the University of Michigan as an instructor in 1957.
He was promoted to assistant professor in 1960, associate professor in 1964, and
professor in 1968. He began his affiliation with the Center for Political Studies at
the Institute for Social Research in 1970 as a research associate, and was named
research scientist in 1974. Professor Barnes served as program director at the
Center for Political Studies from 1970-74 and chair of the Department of Political Science from 1977-82. He has also served as president of the Research Club,
on the executive committee of the Institute for Public Policy Studies, and the executive board of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies. His service to the University has always been marked by his dedication to the development of a vigorous academic community.

July Meeting 1991


Professor Barnes' research has focused on party organization, political representation, the transition to democracy, and the comparative analysis of political
action. The guiding thread that unifies his large body of work is the relationship
between political participation and democratic government. From his early pioneering work on local party leaders and followers in Italy to his more recent comparative work on political action, his central concern has been to enlarge our understanding of the conditions and consequences of citizens' participation in the
political process.
The Regents now salute this distinguished political scientist for his dedicated
service by naming Samuel H. Barnes Professor Emeritus of Political Science and
Research Scientist Emeritus.
Charles B. Beck, professor of botany in the Department of Biology, professor
of paleobotany in the Department of Geological Sciences, and curator in the
Museum of Paleontology, will retire from active faculty status on August 31,
1991, following 35 years of service.
After serving in the U.S. Army from 1944-46, Professor Beck received his
BA degree from the University of Richmond, in Virginia, in 1950. He then entered Cornell University, where he completed his M.S. degree in 1952 and his
Ph.D. degree in 1955 under the guidance of Harlan Banks, a well-known paleobotanist and botany teacher.
Professor Beck came to the University of Michigan as an instructor in the
Department of Botany in 1956; he was promoted to assistant professor in 1957,
associate professor in 1960, and professor in 1965. In addition to teaching
courses in general botany, vascular-plant anatomy, and paleobotany, he was
active in departmental affairs, serving as chair of the department from 1971-75.
Professor Beck was appointed curator of plant fossils in the Museum of Paleontology in 1980 and served as director of the museum from 1987-89.
Professor Beck has contributed significantly to the understanding of the morphology, anatomy, and evolutionary ongin of seed plants. In 1960, he discovered
that the Devonian fossils Archaeopteris, long believed to be an ancient fern, and
Callixylon, woody fragments previously thought to belong to a large conifer-like
tree, were parts of the same ancient plant. For this plant and others like it, called
seed ferns, he proposed the class Progymnospermopsida, which is now accepted as
the ancestral group from which all other seed plants evolved. More recently, his
work has analyzed the possible relationships of this group with both cycads and
conifers. In collaboration with several colleagues, Professor Beck also studied
the morphology of Archaeosperma, one of the earliest known seeds; redefined the
basic homologies of the plant vascular system; and analyzed extensively the anatomy of seed ferns.
Recognition of Professor Beck's scholarship has come in the form of, among
other things, research funding from the National Science Foundation, appointive
offices in the Botanical Society of America, corresponding membership in the
Chinese Botanical Society, and the presidency of the International Organization
of Paleobotany (1987-93).
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his distinguished contributions by naming Charles B. Beck Professor Emeritus of Botany, Professor Emeritus of Paleobotany, and Curator Emeritus.
Lee E. Danielson, professor of human resource management in the School of
Business Administration, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1991.


-12 -



July Meeting, 1991


Professor Danielson received his B.S. degree from Antioch College in 1947
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1949 and
1956, respectively. He joined the School of Business Administration faculty in
1953 as an instructor; he was promoted to assistant professor in 1956, associate
professor in 1959, and professor in 1964. From 1958-59, he served as assistant to
the dean.
Professor Danielson has served the school with distinction and dedication
throughout his career. He has been held in high regard as a teacher, both in
classroom settings and in the numerous seminars he conducts. He has been a
loyal and supportive colleague in his department and the School of Business Administration, including having served on the school's executive committee. He
has also been a good citizen of the University, having served on the advisory committee of the Institute for the Study of Mental Retardation, on the University
Hospital personnel services review committee, and on the financial affairs committee of the Senate Assembly.
Professor Danielson will be missed as a friend, teacher, and colleague, and
the faculty and staff of the School of Business Administration wish him a long
and happy retirement.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Lee E. Danielson
Professor Emeritus of Human Resource Management.
Allen Menlo, professor of education, retired from active faculty status on
May 31, 1991, after 39 years of service to the University of Michigan.
Professor Menlo received his B.S. and M.A. degrees in 1947 and 1948, respectively, from Wayne State University. He came to the University of Michigan
as a research assistant in community adult education in 1950 and a teaching
fellow in educational psychology in 1951, while pursuing his Ph.D. degree. He
was appointed instructor in 1955, completed his Ph.D. degree in 1956, and was
promoted to assistant professor in 1959, associate professor in 1964, and professor in 1969. His work has been diverse, dealing with such areas as educational
psychology; interpersonal, group and organization development; group decision
making; organizational change; leadership; utilizing behavior science knowledge;
and cross-cultural comparative studies of teachers' perceptions, attitudes, and
thinking.
An exceptional teacher, Professor Menlo's concern for collegial collaboration
and his genuine positive regard for all his students have served as a model. His
teaching has been consistently student-centered and has resulted in an enduring
network of former students devoted to him for his concern and his interest in
their learning and growth. In the late 1960s, Professor Menlo developed the Interpersonal Process Program, which became the largest graduate program area in
educational psychology at the University of Michigan.
Professor Menlo has been involved in a number of professional organizations, and has held leadership posts in the American Educational Research Association and the Society for Cross-Cultural Research. He has also served on the
editorial boards of Behavior Science Research, Journal of Worldwide Comparative
Studies, and The Adult Educational Quarterly: A Journal of Research and Theory.
A major theme in Professor Menlo's work has been his commitment to collaborative participation, and he has consulted broadly, both nationally and internationally, on organizational change. In recognition of his excellence in teaching, his
creative approaches in human relations, and his research on the social perceptions of teachers, Professor Menlo has received awards from the Danforth Foundation, the Phi Delta Kappa International Education Organization, the Adult


-13 -



July Meeting, 1991


Education Associations of both Michigan and the United States, the Michigan
Corrections Department, the World Health Organization, and the German Academic Exchange Office. In 1981, Professor Menlo founded the Consortium for
Cross-Cultural Research in Education, which has grown into a partnership of university research teams in 12 countries that collaborate in the planning and conducting of comparative studies of teachers and teaching. He will contue to coordinate the consortium and direct the Michigan research team after his retirement.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Allen
Menlo Professor Emeritus of Education.
Alfred C. Raphelson, professor of psychology at the University of MichiganFlint, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1991, after a a legendary career
as a teacher, mentor, and scholar.
Professor Raphelson received his aB. de e i 1950, his AM. degree in
1951, and his Ph.D. degree in 1956, all from the University of Michigan. He
joined the faculty at what was then known as Flint College in 1956 as an assistant
professor. He was promoted to associate professor in 1960 and professor in 1965.
As one   thfounding members of the Flint faculty, Professor Raphelson
has defined the institutional standard of teaching excellence with his superb
teaching and personal concern for each student. In the 34 years since the founding of UM-Fhnt, no single faculty member has exerted so much influence on the
teaching goals and instructional philosophy of the institution. For hundreds of
former students, the high point of their undergraduate life was their interaction
with Professor Raphelson.
Professor Raphelson's broad interests as a scholar and researcher are reflected in his numerous publications on human motivation, animal behavior, and
the history of psychology. Of special significance to him was his two-volume
work, Psychology at the University of Michigan, which traces the history of the University of Michigan psychology department from 1852-1950.
More than any other faculty member, Professor Raphelson has influenced
the planning and direction of the Flint campus. He served on the Haber Commission, which successfully recommended campus rather than college status for
UM-Flint. He was also a key member of the search committee for the first chancellor, and he played a central part in each campus-wide academic planning
effort. In 1989, he served as the Flint representative on the University faculty
committee for the presidential search.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Alfred C. Raphelson Professor Emeritus of Psychology.
Memorials
No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Nielsen, the Regents approved the final degree lists for the May 1991 Commencement and the tentative
doctoral degree list for the August 1991 Commencement. They also approved
certain specified changes to previously approved degree lists.

July Meeting, 1991


Audit of Student Financial Assistance Programs: July 1, 1988 to June 30, 1990
The Regents received a report of an audit conducted by University Audits
and certified by Ernst & Young to satisfy requirements of the U.S. Department
of Education.
Business School Growth Fund
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents took
the following actions with respect to the Business School Growth Fund:
1) Reappointed Louis G. Allen Mary L Campbell, Cleveland A. Christophe,
Dohn L. Kalmbach, Joel D. Tauber, and Bruce Zenkel, and appointed Gary E.
Baker to the Growth Fund Board of Trustees, all for three-year terms.
2) Renewed the initial one-year appointment of Harold Kellman as alumni
investment manager, for a three-year term ending fall, 1993.
3) Renewed the initial two-year term of Alumni Investment Manager Larry
Goldstein for a three-year term ending fall, 1994.
Regent Smith commended the alumni investment managers on the excellent
performance of the fund.
An Ordinance to Regulate Parking and Traffic, and to Regulate the Use and Protection of the Buildings and Property of the Regents of the University of Michigan
Vice President Womack said that the purpose of the ordinance is to establish
a comprehensive set of ordinances and to make the University's practices consistent, to the extent possible, with those of the city of Ann Arbor. He pointed out
that the Regents had previously adopted chapters 119, 126, and 127 of the city's
ordinances, and that these were included by reference in the proposed ordinance.
He said that each of the articles in the ordinance had been reviewed by the
Safety Committee and by the executive officers, except that Article VIII, having
to do with skateboards, had not been reviewed by the Safety Committee. This article had been included because of the executive officers' concern with the
damage being done by skateboards. He noted that the operation of skateboards,
rollerskates, and rollerblades was only prohibited on property that was posted to
prohibit it; the intent was not to ban them from campus.
Regent Nielsen suggested that the text of Ann Arbor ordinances referred to
as being adopted in the Regents' ordinance be included as part of the language of
the Regents' ordinance, rather than incorporated by reference. He also expressed reservations about the proposed language that refers to the Ann Arbor
ordinance "as amended from time to time". Vice President Womack responded
that the phrase "as amended from time to time" could be struck whenever it
occurs. Thus, whenever the University wished to adopt amendments passed by
the city of Ann Arbor, it would propose the amendments to the Regents for
adoption.

July Meeting, 1991


In response to other questions raised by Regent Nielsen, Vice President
Womack suggested that Regent Nielsen confer with Mr. John Ketelhut, deputy
general counsel, who is familiar with the legal issues involved.
Regent Baker arrived at the meeting at 1:55 P.M. He commented on the
damage that has been done by skateboards on the Ingalls Mall. Regent Baker
also commented that provisions against yelling on University buses might impinge on free speech rights.
President Duderstadt reiterated that the regulations pertaining to skateboards, rollerblades, and rollerskates only applied to areas that would be posted;
there would not be a campus-wide ban of those items. Because people had
signed up to speak during the public comments session about this action, the vote
would be delayed until the next day.
FY1991-92 Ann Arbor General Fund Operating Budget and Student Fee Rates
President Duderstadt called on Provost Whitaker to present the FY1991-92
General Fund Operating Budget for the Ann Arbor campus. Provost Whitaker
began by reviewing the budget preparation timeline. He noted that because the
legislature had not yet acted on its 1991-92 budget, assumptions have been used
in planning the general fund budget.
Provost Whitaker noted that last October the University had requested an
8.5 percent increase ($21.6 million) in state appropriation as part of a multi-year
plan to bring the state back into the top one-third of states in terms of support of
higher education. Since then, the state had reduced the 1990-91 appropriation by
1.0 percent, $3.4 million in special maintenance funding had been rolled back,
the remaiing FY1990-91 payments ($25 million) had been deferred, and the
projected net increase in state appropriation for FY1991-92 had been determined
to be only 3.7 percent over the previous year, or $12.3 million less than the request.
To deal with this situation, Provost Whitaker reported that the following actions would be undertaken: Cost containment measures (reduced salary program, cancellation or deferral of all but essential expenditures, implementation
of a total quality management program); internal reallocation measures ($5.7
million off the top for the University Initiative Fund, additional internal reallocation at the unit level, following recommendations of the PACE committee); and
revenue measures (tuition increase). With the proposed 7 percent tuition increase, the net shortfall from the original October proposal would be $9.4 million.
Provost Whitaker announced that because of the elimination of "special
maintenance" funding by the state over the past several years, an infrastructure
maintenance fee of $50 per term was also being proposed to address the highest
priority equipment and facility renovation needs. For the fifth year, an allocation
will be taken "off the top" of the general fund budget for the University Initiative
Fund. For 1991-92, this will amount to $5.7 million ($2.3 million for critical academic needs, $1.0 million for minority faculty recruitment and retention; $0.9
million for research support; $0.7 million for additional financial aid; and $0.8
million for University Library acquisitions).


-16 -



July Meeting, 1991


The recommended FY1991-92 general fund revenue budget of $606.2 million
is $37.7 million higher than the 1990-91 budget. Planned new expenditures include a net general base budget increase of $10.9 million, $4.5 million for staff
benefit increases; $6.0 million for financial aid, $0.9 million for facility opening
costs (renovated facilities with increased operating costs); $2.3 million for critical
academic needs (for schools and colleges); $1.0 million for minority faculty recruitment and retention; $2.4 million for academic program underfunding; $1.0
million for new program initiatives; $3.4 million for "pass through" revenue (tuition passed through to units with special tuition programs due to higher costs or
enrolment changes); $4.6 million for other costs (primarily fixed); a decrease of
$2.7 million as a base budget reallocation (1 percent rollback); and $3.4 million
for infrastructure maintenance.
Provost Whitaker reiterated that it is the University's policy to meet the demonstrated financial need of all regularly enrolled Michigan resident undergraduate students. He then reviewed  e proposed new tuition and fee schedules and
displayed charts and graphs showing how the University's increase compared with
those at other Michigan public uiversities, as well as cost comparisons for a
Michigan undergraduate student to attend the University of Michigan versus its
national eer institutions. Provost Whitaker concluded his presentation by illustrating the continuing decline in state appropriation adjusted for inflation in
recent years; the annual percentage change i general fund revenue; and the continuing decrease in the proportion of general fund revenue derived from state appropriation and concomitant increase in the proportion derived from tuition and
fees.
1991-92 UM-Dearborn General Fund Budget and Student Fee Rates
President Duderstadt then called on Chancellor Wilson to present the UMDearborn General Fund Budget. Chancellor Wilson stated that the priorities in
the UM-Dearborn budget were to upgrade faculty salary levels to a more competitive level, to provide additional student financial aid, support for instruction,
research, and the library, and improving information technology capabilities.
Chancellor Wilson distributed a handout with charts and graphs comparing
UM-Dearborn's financial situation (state appropriation, faculty salaries, and
amount of debt service) with that of its Michigan HA peer institutions. She also
noted that the budget provides for a staff equity salary program which would increment the salaries of staff members making less than $35,000 in addition to the
proposed salary program. She also said that reallocations had been made to
target the highest budget priorities. Chancellor Wilson described the information
technology program, a new inititiative that will provide updated computer laboratories, local area networks, a library computer system, multimedia classrooms, a
management information system, and touchtone registration. $500,000 has been
budgeted to initiate this program.
The UM-Dearborn proposed student fee rates for 1991-92 call for an increase of 7.9 percent for lower-division undergraduate and graduate students and
9.9 percent for upper-division undergraduate students. The proposed 1991-92
general fund budget increase is $3,024,000. This is made up of $850,000 in state

July Meeting, 1991


appropriations, $1,931,000 in student fees, $233,000 in other revenue, and
$20,000 from indirect cost reimbursement.
1991-92 UM-Flint General Fund Budget and Student Fee Rates
Chancellor Jones reviewed the process of budget development on the Flint
campus, noting that budget development includes input from the Chancellor's
Cabinet, which includes student, faculty, and staff representatives, and the
Budget Priorities Committee, a faculty body.
The proposed incremental budget increase of 5.3 percent, coupled with a tuition increase of 6.4 percent for resident undergraduates and 8.5 percent for all
other students, will yield an increase of $2,062,300 over the 1990-91 budget. The
Flint campus is also proposing a $40 registration fee, effective fall, 1991. The incremental revenue increase is comprised of $632,165 in state appropriations,
$800,000 in tuition, $530,000 from registration fees, and $100,135 from other
sources. He pointed out that spending priorities are aimed at improving faculty
and staff salaries ($1,455,232 total) and increasing student financial aid to offset
the tuition increase ($225,000). He said that a special program would be instituted to lesson the impact of the registration fee on part-time students. The expenditure budget also calls for programmatic initiatives of $327,068 (including library acquisitions and minority recruitment).
Comments by President Duderstadt
President Duderstadt pointed out that the state legislature would be unlikely
to act on the budget request until September, and that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the state's financial health and its ability to meet the University's
needs. He said that great restraints had been used in preparing the budgets for
all three campuses, including a salary program less than inflation and budget cuts.
He noted that the University of Michigan is 24th of the top 25 universities in the
United States in cost, and that the 7 percent tuition increase on the Ann Arbor
campus is less than that at most other public institutions across the country. He
pointed out that tuition increases have lagged personal income and inflationary
increases over the past eight years, despite state appropriation increases that
have been below the rate of inflation.
He observed that two-thirds of all students receive some form of financial
aid, which means that the more affluent families who don't receive financial aid
are actually providing assistance to less affluent families. In effect, he said that
tuition is a progressive tax that allows people with higher incomes to pay more of
their fair share, while the less fortunate are provided opportunity for access.
President Duderstadt said that he was encouraged by the governor's attitude
that education must be protected and remain a high priority for state government. But he recognized the uncertainties that will remain while the budget process is still underway. He then opened up the floor to comments from the Regents.
Regent Baker asked for a further explanation of the relationship between a
student whose tuition is highly subsidized and one who pays the full instate fee.


-18 -



July Meeting, 1991


The president noted that all students are subsidized in some form. The estimated cost of a year of education at the University of Michigan is about $18,000;
the full tuition charged to a Michigan resident represents from 15 to 20 percent
of the true cost of tat education. In response to another question from Regent
Baker, the president stated that nonresident students receive subsidies not from
state appropriation, but from private and federal sources.
Regent Baker said that the special maintenance fee bothered him philosophically, because various fees have been added over the years and that this base
continues to grow. He asked whether money to be raised by the building maintenance fee might be found elsewhere by reducing costs rather than instituting a
fee.
Provost Whitaker responded to a question from Regent McFee about how
student financial aid is divided between grants and loans. He noted that individual family circumstances are considered for each loan package.
Regent Power pointed out that given the uncertainty of the state's financial
situation, there is a possibility of an executive order that would reduce the
amount of the University's appropriation once it is finally approved, and that the
state could defer other payments besides the $25 million of the 1990-91 appropriation that has already been deferred. He was concerned that the state might
never meet its obligation.
In the discussion that followed, President Duderstadt pointed out that what
the state was really doing was borrowing from higher education. Vice President
Womack stated that the carrying cost of borrowing the $25 million payment that
the state had already deferred was about $1.3 million, and that there were other
costs associated with the deferral as well. Provost Whitaker observed that these
costs had been accounted for in drawing up the budget, and that the University
intended to manage against the known budget contingencies.
In response to a question from Regent Smith about the $50 special maintenance fee, President Duderstadt explained that the loss of state support for deferred maintenance represented a 1.5 percent reduction in the base budget. He
said that this fee would remain in place until the state restores funding for deferred building maintenance.
Regent Smith asked if any financial assistance was being provided for middle
income students. Provost Whitaker noted that an additional $700,000 had been
put into the financial aid budget in an effort to increase the amount of the proportion of aid designated for grants as opposed to loans. He noted that the constraint for middle income students is that they do not qualify for federal aid.
President Duderstadt noted that University personnel were hopeful that the
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act would contain a direct student loan
program without a needs test, which would assist middle income students.
Regent Varner commented that separating the infrastructure maintenance
fee from tuition highlights one of the most critcal funding problems the University has faced for a number of years: that the state has not been carrying out its
responsibility for funding either maintenance of existing facilities or new facilities

July Meeting, 1991


construction. Regarding the proposed tuition increase at the Dearborn campus,
she expressed concern about how this would affect that campus' competitiveness
with other institutions in its service area, particularly Wayne State Umversity.
Chancellor Wilson replied that she and her colleagues shared this concern
and monitor this situation closely. She reported that UM-Dearborn had surveyed
students who had decided not to attend UM-Dearborn. From this it had been
determined that cost per se was not the deciding factor in this decision; rather it
was whether the student could afford to attend with the financial aid package offered by UM-Dearborn
Vice President Womack responded to a question from Regent Baker about
how the $25 million payment deferred by the state would be treated in the budget
by stating that it is being considered a deferred revenue item. If the state does
not repay the $25 million, the books would show a $25 million shortfall, which,
Regent Baker noted, would mean that the budget was not balanced. Regent
Power pointed out that the real cost of this deferral included an additional $1.7
million in lost interest income.

(AATU); Marc Beginin, student, on the proposed ordinance against skateboarding, rollerblading, and rollerskating; Amy Elen Polk, student, on the MSA, Student Legal Services (SLS), and AATU budgets and the MSA student fee;
Sharmatizen and former staff member, on the proposed faculty/staff

The meeting was recessed at 5:00 P.M.
Friday, July 19, 1991
The Regents met at 9:00 AM. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Power, Smith, Varner, and
Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Johnson, Kelly, Swain, and Womack were also present, as
were Chancellors Jones and Wilson. Regent Nielsen was absent.
1991-92 Revenue Budgets
UM-Ann Arbor Student Fee Rates for 1991-92
UM-Dearborn Student Fee Rates for 1991-92
UM-Flint Student Fee Rates for 1991-92
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and asked Provost
Whitaker to explain the tuition and fee proposals. Provost Whitaker stated that
the action request for the Ann Arbor campus is for a tuition increase of 7.0
percent for all students except for those in programs in Law, Business Administration MBA, Engineering, Kinesiology, and Pharmacy, which would have special
increases as described in the Regents Communication. There is also a $50 per
term fee for all students, which is devoted to infrastructure maintenance and
equipment replacement. This fee will always be separately identified in the
budget, and there would be the option of dropping the fee if the state reinstituted
its funding for this.
Regent Brown moved approval of the recommended student fee rates for all
three campuses. Regent Varner seconded the motion. Regent Smith asked that
the minutes reflect the statement that at no time will the maintenance fee be absorbed in the tuition fee. Regent Brown restated his motion as approval of the
recommended student fee rates for all three campuses, and that the special maintenance fee is to remain separate unless it is otherwise approved by the Regents.
Regent McFee commented on the difficulty of keeping tuition as low as possible in the face of the increasing discrepancy between the proportion of the general fund budget funded by the state and that funded by tuition. She expressed
the hope that in the future this trend will be reversed, and that public support for
this public university will return to what it should be.
There being no further comments, the vote was taken, and the motion carried, with Regents Brown, Power, McFee, Smith, Varner, and Waters in favor
and Regent Baker abstaining.

July Meeting, 1991


An Ordinance to Regulate Parking and Traffic, and to Regulate the Use and Protection of the Buildings and Property of the Regents of the University of Michigan
President Duderstadt stated that after listening to public comments and to
the concerns raised by students on campus, the officers have gained a better understanding about the issue of banning rollerskates and rollerblades as well as
skateboards on campus. Therefore, the ordinance will be rephrased so as to ban
skateboards, rollerskates, and rollerblades from parking structures and University
buildings, but that the remainder of the ordinance will apply only to skateboards,
which will be banned campus-wide (not only in posted areas). Thus, there would
be no constraints on rollerblades or rollerskates outside of parking structures and
campus buildings.
Vice President Womack stated that in response to suggestions from Regent
Nielsen, the phrases on pages 8 and 14, "as amended from time to time", would
be struck from the ordinance. Also, throughout the University's ordinance, all
references to the incorporation of the Ann Arbor ordinances into the University's
ordinances would be removed; instead, in each instance, the University's
ordinance would include the specific language of the relevant Ann Arbor ordinances when the ordinance is published. Vice President Womack also noted that
in Article XIII, Section 1, Paragraph 2 ("Fines and Imprisonment"), specific existing fines for violations of Article II (Traffic and Parking) would be spelled out,
and penalties for violations of other articles will be as provided in the University's ordinance.
Regent Brown moved adoption of the ordinance as amended by Vice President Womack. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Regent Baker stated that he supported the ordinance, but noted that rollerskates and rollerblades should not be used in a manner so as to threaten public
safety. In response to a question about fraternity houses, Vice President Womack
stated that the ordinance would not apply to them. Regent Baker also asked that
counsel review certain other provisions of the ordinance to ensure that they do
not restrict free assembly or free speech.
Regent Baker also expressed concern that Article XII, Section 1, paragraph
5, which identifies as disorderly conduct "fail[ure] to identify oneself accurately
when requested to do so by a police officer or Department of Public Safety security officer after the officer observes the person commit[ting] a civil infraction,
misdemeanor or felony, or when the officer has probable cause to believe the
person has committed a misdemeanor or felony outside of the officer's presence",
may be an inhibition of free speech. Regents Brown and Waters responded that
this is standard criminal law language in Michigan. Regent Waters noted that if
the officer has no reason to believe a crime has been committed, a person has no
obligation to produce identification. Vice President Womack pointed out that
this language parallels the existing Ann Arbor ordinance. Regent Baker asked
that the minutes reflect that police power ought not to be used for intimidation
on campus.
In response to a question from Regent Power about the effective date of the
ordinance, Vice President Womack stated it would be effective immediately


-22 -



July Meeting, 1991


upon approval, and that it, along with all other University ordinances, would be
published regularly. Regent Power observed that it was important to communicate what the ordinance says to members of the University community.
Regent Brown noted that the University's ordinances are subject to state law.
Mr. William Krumm, associate vice president for business operations, who was
present at the meeting, stated that state law requires that all regental ordinances
be posted in three prominent places on campus. However, it would be effective
immediately.
Regent McFee suggested that the portions of the ordinance pertaining to
skateboards, rollerskates, and rollerblades be posted prominently in places currently being used for these activities. Regent Baker responded that he felt the
usual procedure for posting should be followed.
Regent McFee requested that the Regents receive copies of the ordinances
once the changes are made. There being no further discussion, the vote was
taken, and the motion to approve the ordinance as amended was adopted unanimously. The text of the ordinance as amended is included in the appendix.
Medical Science Research Building III
With regard to the Medical Science Research Building HI, Regent McFee
moved, Regent Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved the
project budget, and authorized soliciting of bids and awarding a construction contract to the successful bidder, providing the contract value is within the approved
budget.
Vice President Womack responded to questions and comments from the Regents about the proposed financing plan for the Medical Science Research Buildmg III. Following some discussion, the ii, tRegents also authorized proceeding with
financing for Medical Service Plan Revenue Bonds, Series 1991, as follows: The
Regents authorized and directed the vice president and chief financial officer to
proceed with a program for financing the construction cash flow requirements for
the Medical Science Research Building Im, and in particular, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, that the vice president and chief financial officer 1)
together with the underwriters, develop the terms and legal documentation for
the bonds, and prepare and circulate a preliminary official statement describing
the bonds, the University, the Medical School, the Medical Service Plan, and its
affairs; 2) to apply for and obtain from Moody's Investors Service and Standard
& Poor's Corporation their ratings on the bonds; and 3) to obtain a final proposal
for the bonds, including price and interest rate, negotiate, execute, and deliver
the bond purchase agreement with the underwriters, setting forth the terms of the
bonds and sale thereof, all within the limitations of the following resolution.
Regent Baker requested that the Regents be provided with copies of the final
document prior to consummating the sale of the bonds.

1991-92 MSA Fee Assessments
Vice President Swain emphasized that the proposed 1991-92 MSA budget includes funding for a position to provide professional oversight of MSA financial
operations. She stated that she believed the budget recommendations were prudent, and she concurred with them.


-25 -



July Meeting, 1991


Regent Baker moved approval of the recommended 1991-92 fee assessments
of $6.27 per student per term for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), $0.35 per
student per term for Michigan Collegiate Coalition (MCC), and $1.00 per student
per term for school/college governments. Regent Baker commented that the
MSA officers had been elected by substantial margins, appear to have a broad
degree of support among the student body, and have been willing to cooperate
with the executive officers, and he felt they deserved support from the Regents.
Regent McFee observed that several speakers at Public Comments had objected to the cuts being proposed by MSA to the budgets of the Ann Arbor Tenants Union (AATU) as well as how these cuts would affect Student Legal Services (SLS). Other speakers had claimed that a significant portion of the activities carried on by AATU are political and not directly related to students.
Regent McFee asked that the Regents be provided with some documentation of
the activities and finances of these organizations to guide them in future budget
decisions.
Regent Smith seconded Regent Baker's motion.
Regent Power noted that although Regents are regularly lobbied to influence
how MSA handles it budget, it is not the Regents' business how MSA chooses to
allocate the money it receives from student fees.
Following further discussion, the vote was taken, and the motion to approve
the 1991-92 fee assessments for Michigan Student Assembly, Michigan Collegiate
Coalition, and school/college governments was adopted unanimously.
1991-92 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Swain said that authorization was being sought to increase the
University Health Service fee by $4.00 per student per term (5.11 percent) for
1991-92, which will raise the fee to $82.25 per student per term. She noted that
health service fee increases consistently have been less than those of the general
health care sector, indicating prudent management by health service staff.
Regent Smith moved to increase the University Health Service fee by $4.00
per term. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Regent Baker observed that although the argument is always made that it is
more efficient to assess a health service fee for all students, it is unfair for parents
who pay for private health insurance to also have to- pay an additional fee for
University Health Service. Because health care costs have been rising so rapidly,
Regent Baker suggested that this issue be examined again.
Regent McFee noted that often families or employers are paying double premiums for health care coverage, but are not receiving double reimbursement.
She suggested this issue be looked at so that parents and employers can help contain rapidly rising health care costs by eliminating double premiums where possible.


-26 -



July Meeting, 1991


Regent Power commended Dr. Cesar Briefer, director of University Health
Service, for having held the rate of increase in health care coverage to below
national levels.
Dr. Briefer noted that University Health Service was going to begin collecting for reimbursable services from students' private health insurance companies,
although he emphasized that the majority of the care provided by health service
is in the form of office visits, which generally are not covered by private health
insurance. He also pointed out that the health service fee is not really an insurance program; it covers all co-pays and deductibles from insurance so that students and parents are never billed directly for its services. Only insurance companies will be billed, and this will only occur if a student signs an informed release of information to be sent to the insurance company.
There being no further discussion, the vote was taken and the motion to increase the University Health Service fee for 1991-92 by $4.00 per student per
term was approved unanimously.
Michigan Collegiate Coalition
Regent Baker stated that when he made his motion to approve the MSA fee
assessments, he had not understood that the motion included the fee for the student lobbying organization (Michigan Collegiate Coalition). He stated his opinion that the MCC fee should be voluntary, because it has to do with political
action, and people should not have to pay for political representation which they
might not want.
Regent Waters left the meeting at this point (10:30 A.M.).
Regent Power observed that there is a big gap between the $75,000 in student fees that goes to Michigan Collegiate Coalition and what they claim to have
accomplished. Regent Smith agreed. Regent McFee suggested that consideration be given to making the MCC fee a checkoff item in the future.
Reports
Regent Baker thanked Vice President Womack for including the report on
mortgages in the investment report.
Regarding the litigation report, Regent Baker noted a case involving a medical center employee who had tested HIV positive. He said that this raises the
issue of what the University policy is regarding employees who are HIV positive,
and what latitude such employees are given to practice their professions. He said
that this issue is analogous to what occurred when the University first undertook
studies of DNA, when people were uncertain of the effect of this material on the
general population. At that time experts were invited to discuss the issue and
ultimately guidelines were adopted regarding the study of DNA. He stated that a
policy ought to be developed to deal with the issues raised by this lawsuit as well.
Regent Power stated his hope that medical professionals would be invited to
submit their views to the Board, rather than having the Board impose its views on
them.

July Meeting 1991


University of Michigan Hospitals Mott Renewal Project
Vice President Womack introduced Mr. Douglas Hanna, assistant director of
capital programs in the Plant Extension Office, to describe the project. Mr.
Hanna used architectural renderings and schematic designs to describe the
project, which includes renovation of the patient unit floors of Mott Hospital; a
replacement receiving dock and emergency generator; two new operating rooms
and support space; renovation of the existing operating room suite; a new radiographic room and ultrasound room, and support space; a new addition to house
the present occupants of the old Women's Hospital building (excluding the obstetrics unit) to provide for its demolition; demolition of the old Women's Hospital building; and replacement of many of the old building systems and components in the Mott and Holden buildings.
Mr. Hanna responded to questions from the Regents, and then, there being
no further discussion, Regent Power moved approval of the Mott Renewal
Project design as presented. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was
adopted.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved the following projects: 1) replacement of the Intercollegiate Athletics golf course sprinkler system; 2) installation of North Campus duct
banks for the telecommunications department; and 3) renovation of the basement of Unit B in the School of Dentistry (three phases).
Regent Baker commended Regent Brown for volunteering to lead the fundraising drive for the golf course renovation project.
Proposed Research Subcontract between the University of Michigan and Merit
Network, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Power, all six Regents
present unanimously approved a proposed subcontract between the University of
Michigan and Merit Network, Inc. (MERIT). MERIT has been awarded a subcontract from Advanced Network and Services, Inc. (ANS). Douglas E. Van
Houweling, vice provost for information technology, represents the University of
Michigan on the MERIT board of directors and is also chair of the board of directors of ANS. Eric M. Aupperle, associate director of Merit, Network Systems,
at the University of Michigan, serves as president of MERIT.
This subcontract falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute, because Mr. Van Houweling is a director of MERIT and ANS and an
employee of the University, and Mr. Aupperle is an officer of MERIT and an
employee of the University. The following information is provided in compliance
with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the subcontract will be MERIT and the Regents of the
University of Michigan. Mortez Rahimi, vice president for com

-28 -



July Meeting, 1991


puting and information technology of Wayne State University, will
sign the subcontract as chair of the board of directors of MERIT.
2.  The subcontract will obligate the University to perform certain services required of MERIT in its agreement with ANS. The terms of
the subcontract are in compliance with University policies
regarding other sponsored activity conducted at the University.
MERITs obligations under its contract with ANS will be carried
out by University employees. The University will receive $587,582
over approximately a 16 month period ending October 31, 1992, to
cover actual costs for the performance of the subcontract,
including full indirect cost at the negotiated rate for other
sponsored activity. The proposed scope of work and budget are
described in the subcontract.
3.  Neither Van Houweling nor Aupperle receives a salary or other
pecuniary benefit from MERIT and neither is receiving any portion of his University salary from the performance of this subcontract.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and Michigan
Critical Care Consultants
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Power, all six Regents
present unanimously approved the University's entering into a license agreement
with Michigan Critical Care Consultants, Inc. The proposed agreement falls
under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute, since the owners of
Michigan Critical Care Consultants and developers of the technology to be
commercialized (a self-regulating-blood pump and a Venturi-type flow meter),
Robert H. Bartlett, Scott I. Merz, and J. Patrick Montoya (the "Developers"), are
also University employees. The following information is provided in compliance
with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the Regents of the University of
Michigan and Michigan Critical Care Consultants, a corporation
owned by the Developers.
2.  Terms of the contract include: a duration for ten years or the term
of the last to expire of the licensed patents, and consideration to
the University consisting of payment of royalties, including minimum royalties, on sales of the technology and on sublicense rights
granted in the technology. Royalties will be paid at a rate of 5
percent for revenues from the sale or use of patented technology,
2.5 percent for revenues from the sale or use of unpatented technology, and 25 percent of revenues generated by sublicenses in the
technology. Minimum royalties shall commence on the agreement's third full year at $1,000 -each year. The University retains
ownership of all technology, and will be assigned joint ownership
of any inventions relating to the technology which are created
jointly by University employees and Michigan Critical Care Consultants employees, and will also be assigned sole ownership of any


-29 -



July Meeting, 1991


inventions relating to the technology which are created by University employees who are concurrently employed by Michigan Critical Care Consultants. The University retains the right to use the
technology for research and educationally-related purposes, and
for its own clinical use. Michigan Critical Care Consultants shall
diligently pursue the commercial development and exploitation of
the technology. There is no use of facilities or services of the
University included in the contract and no assignment of University employees for fulfillment of the contract.
3.  The Developers' pecuniary interest in the contract arises from
their ownership of Michigan Critical Care Consultants. This corporation will receive revenues from the sale, use, and sublicensing
of the technology, and the University will receive a share of those
revenues. The developers' interest in that corporation will be in
lieu of participation in the sharing of royalties received by the
University in accordance with University policy.
Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved a change in the size and composition of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics from a 21-member board to a 13-member board.
The changes will occur over a three-year period, according to the schedule described in the Regents Communication. The 13-member board will consist of 6
members of the Faculty Senate, 1 faculty representative to the Big Ten Conference, 2 alumni/ae representatives, 2 student representatives, 1 executive officer,
ex officio, and 1 director of athletics, ex officio, without vote.
New Degree Title in School of Music
Provost Whitaker noted that this new degree is intended to meet the needs of
a small number of students who would like to combine liberal arts with a professional dance program. On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent
Brown, the Regents unanimously approved establishment of the degree "Bachelor of Dance Arts" in the School of Music. Regent McFee noted that this highlights the fact that a large institution can be sensitive to the needs of the individual.
Medical Staff Appointments
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Brown, and on the recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board, the Regents unanimously approved several appointments to medical staff membership.
University of Michigan Policy on Sexual Harassment by Faculty and Staff
Regent McFee noted that a speaker at the public comments session had
commented on the impression conveyed by the media about the Regents' discussion regarding the sexual harassment policy at the last meeting. She stated that
the Regents had addressed the policy with serious concern, not with the levity


-30 -



July Meeting, 1991


that had been conveyed by the media. She felt the Regents had two areas of concern regarding the policy: 1) whether or not the policy would intrude on areas it
is not intended to regulate, that is, matters which are and should remain private;
and 2) concern that the language of the policy did not provide opportunity to address capricious and malicious sexual harassment matters.
Regent McFee noted that in trying to develop a policy which will both create
an element of trust where people feel they can come forth with sexual harassment complaints, one needs to be cognizant of the rights of individuals to be protected against capricious and malicious accusations. Her impression of the
Board's discussion was that serious attention was paid to those matters, and that
legal counsel had been requested to make corrections in those areas and return it
to the Regents for review. The intent was to ensure that the final policy would
have those safeguards in it, as well as those pro-active issues it was intended to
address. She regretted if a contrary impression had been conveyed to the community.
Regents Baker and Brown supported Regent McFee's observation.
City of Ann Arbor Blue Ribbon Committee
Regent Baker noted that the mayor had recently appointed a blue ribbon
committee, consisting of several University faculty and other residents, to study
major issues confronting the city. He asked whether the committee was an "official" University/city committee.
Mr. Walter Harrison, executive director of university relations, responded
that certain members of the University faculty with expertise in taxation and
other financial matters had been asked to serve on this committee. These faculty
had agreed to serve on the committee as individuals, and not in their official
University capacity. In addition, the Institute of Public Policy Studies would be
offering a class in which students would be able to earn credit by helping with the
work of the committee.
There being no further discussion, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting is scheduled for September 19-20, 1991. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses for the month of June 1991

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1991


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, September 19, 1991
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner,
and Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Johnson, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were
Chancellors Jones and Wilson. Vice President Swain was absent.
University Annual Financial Statements for 1990-91
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Vice President Womack to present the annual financial statements for 1990-91. Vice President Womack turned to the report of the independent auditors, Ernst and
Young, and read the following paragraph, which he described as a clean opinion:
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the University of Michigan at June 30,
1991, and the changes in fund balances and the current funds revenues, expenditures, and transfers for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Following further comments, Vice President Womack announced that the report of year-end financial information would be given by Messrs. Chandler
Matthews, associate vice president for finance and controller, and Robert W.
Moenart, director of financial operations.
Year-End Financial Information for 1990-91
Mr. Matthews and Mr. Moenart gave a slide presentation on the year-end financial information for 1990-91, beginning with current funds, which include the
General, Designated, and Expendable-Restricted Funds and are sometimes referred to as the Educational and General Funds. Both funds were compared
with the same funds for the fiscal year 1981-82. In 1990-91, total educational and
general current fund revenues were $1.011 billion, compared with $450 million
for 1981-82. Mr. Matthews noted that in 1990-91, the proportion of the current
funds derived from state appropriations had declined from 33.7 percent to 26.7
percent over a ten-year period, while the proportion derived from student fees
had risen from 25.4 percent to 29.2 percent during that time. Private gifts and
sponsored programs had also increased during that time, from 7.9 percent of the
total to 10.3 percent (ten-year compound growth rate of 12.7 percent). The total
compound growth rate for the current funds over the ten-year period was 9.4 percent.
Regent Baker pointed out that student fees had increased proportionately as
state appropriations had decreased. In response to a comment from Regent
Brown, President Duderstadt noted that funds for student financial aid over the
ten-year period had increased at a greater rate than student fees, thus lessening
the impact of tuition increases for many students. The increased financial aid


-45 -



September Meeting, 1991


was required because of the federal and state governments' withdrawal of support for higher education.
With regard to current funds expenditures, Mr. Matthews reported that the
largest category of expenditure is total compensation (salaries and wages plus
staff benefits), which accounted for 66.1 percent of expenditures in 1981-82 and
58.6 percent in 1990-91, for a compound annual growth rate of 8.5 percent.
Schoarships and fellowships rose fom 7.5 percent of the expenditue budget in
1981-82 to 8.5 percent in 1990-91, for an 11 percent i, for growth rate, confirming the
president's previous comment. Although the proportion of expenditures devoted
to supplies remained virtually the same (about 21.0 percent), that category experienced a compound annual growth rate of 10.5 percent. The other major expenditure category, equipment and plant, grew from 5.4 percent of the total to 11.1
percent, for a growth rate of 19.1 percent. Revenues and expenditures for auxillary activities are driven largely by hospital and medical activities, so were displayed separately from the Educational and General Funds.
Mr. Matthews concluded by stating that the University had received a clean
opinion from its auditors, and that the University was solvent and well positioned
to meet challenges that it will face in the coming year. Mr. Matthews and Vice
President Womack then responded to questions from the Regents about the
audit report and the financial information that had been presented so far. Then,
there being no further discussion, Regent Baker moved adoption of the University Annual Financial Statements for 1990-91. Regent Varner seconded the
motion, and it was adopted unanimously.
1991-92 Revenue and Expenditure Budgets
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Womack to present the
1991-92 current funds budgets. Vice President Womack noted that the current
funds include the General Fund, Designated Fund, Auxiliary Activities Fund, and
Expendable Restricted Fund. Total 1991-92 revenues for all three campuses are
projected to be $1,889,386,722 (a 7.2 percent increase over 1990-91); expenditures will be $1,867,575,278 (7.8 percent increase). State appropriations are
budgeted at $307,339,554; student tuition and fees are $319,637,226. The
General Fund makes up 36.0 percent of the revenue budget ($675.1 million), the
Expendable Restricted Fund 18.0 percent ($333.6 million), the Designated Fund
3.0 percent ($59.7 million), the medical component of the Auxiliary Activities
Fund, 39.0 percent (almost $729 million); and the other auxiliary activities about
4.0 percent (about $80 million). The compound growth rate from fiscal year 1983
is 10.1 percent.
Vice President Womack then called on Provost Whitaker to present details
of the General Fund budget. Provost Whitaker reported that the total General
Fund revenue budget of $675.1 million is derived fom tuition and fees (47 percent), state appropriations (43 percent), indirect cost recovery (8 percent), and
other sources (mostly interest income â€”2 percent). General Fund expenditures by
function are devoted to instruction (44 percent), academic support (17 percent),
plant operations (13 percent), scholarships (7 percent), research (4 percent), and
'other" (public service, student service, institutional support, mandatory transfers,
and enforced savings) (15 percent). Considered by object of expenditure, 67 percent of General Fund expenditures are for salaries and benefits, 26 percent for
nonsalaries, and 7 percent for financial aid. Provost Whitaker also displayed a


-46 -



September Meeting, 1991


bar chart illustrating budgeted General Fund expenditures for the vice presidential areas; these total $232.4 million.
Provost Whitaker then presented details of expenditure budgets for the vice
president for academic affairs and vice president and chief financial officer and
for some of the schools and colleges, responding to questions and comments from
the Regents. Noting the $800,000 increase in the University Library budget for
library acquisitions, Regent Power asked to receive a report on why the costs for
periodicals have risen so dramatically over the past several years, and what could
be done about it. Provost Whitaker pointed out that the 1991-92 undergraduate
student aid budget had been increased by 12.1 percent, greater than the student
fee increase, in an effort to be responsive to student needs in this area. Regarding the utilities budget, Provost Whitaker noted that utility costs were beginning
to rise after remaining somewhat flat for several years. Regent Baker expressed
an interest in knowing how the cogeneration facility and other energy saving
measures had effected the cost increases.
Following Provost Whitaker's presentation about the General Fund budget
for the Ann Arbor campus, Chancellor Jones commented about the Flint
campus' operating budget. He noted the increasing pattern of reliance on tuition
as a revenue source. Whereas as in 1990-91, state appropriation accounted for 56
percent of the revenue source base, in 1991-92, that figure will drop to 54 percent. He explained that a negative change in the government sponsored programs category was due to the expiration of the bilingual education program, a
arge federal program on the Flint campus. Chancellor Jones pointed out several
other features of the revenue and expenditure budget, after which the provost
called on Chancellor Wilson to present the Dearborn budget.
Chancellor Wilson observed that the Dearborn campus had seen a more significant shift than had the Flint campus in dependence on tuition income for revenues. She then enumerated some of the policy changes that have driven some
of the budget changes: having the PACE rogram become more self-supporting;
the elimination of the UM-Dearborn pubications office and turning those funds
over to the new Office of Institutional Advancement; and moving the programs
that had been housed in the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies into the faculty
units throughout the University, thus eliminating the centralized interdisciplinary
studies division. Following Chancellor Wilson's remarks, she responded to questions about the UM-Dearborn budget.
Vice President Womack then continued the presentation with a description
of the Designated, Auxiliary Activities, and Expendable Restricted Funds. In the
discussion that followed, Regent Power asked what contingency plans were being
made, given the uncertain state budget situation.
President Duderstadt described the budgetary risk factors as being a) the uncertain nature of the state appropriation process, which is expected to be resolved much as the University had expected; b) the deferred payments of state
appropriations for the months of July, August, and September, 1991, which
amount to over $25 million, and the risk that these will never be paid; and c) the
uncertainties in the federal arena, including research activities budgets and policies on overhead reimbursement. He stated that the budget had been assembled
with contingencies in mind, but that most of the contingency factors are in the expenditure area.


-47 -



September Meeting, 1991
Provost Whitaker reported that enough money had been sequestered in the
budget to make up for a possible shortfall in the actual amount of state appropriations versus what planners had predicted. But the more serious potential difficulty is the state revenue projections, which could lead to potential executive
order budget reductions. He said that the vice presidents had been cautioned to
be very careful in expenditures and in managing personnel turnover. The belief
is that centrally managed budget planning, i.e., freezes, are ill-advised, as individual units are in better positions to judge their own unique situations. Provost
Whitaker reported that the deans and vice presidents are formulating contingency plans to deal with potential budget shortfalls.
Regent Baker pointed out that all of the factors causing the budget uncertainties constitute a serious matter for the administration, making this a difficult
time for the University. President Duderstadt noted that this was a difficult time
for public higher education across the United States, and that in several years,
this situation would extend to private institutions as well.
Regent Power noted that much prudence and care had been put into preparation of this budget in light of these financial uncertainties. Then, there being
no further discussion, Regent Power moved approval of the 1991-92 revenue and
expenditure budgets. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was adopted
unanimously. There followed a ten minute recess.
The meeting resumed following the recess, at 2:55 PM.
Minutes
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the minutes of the meeting of July 18-19, 1991.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports on Investment Transactions, Plant
Extension, Endowment Fund Quarterly Inventory (included in the Report of Investments for Year-Ended 6/30/91), Litigation, and Personnel-Labor Relations,
and responded to comments and questions from the Regents. Regarding the Litigation Report, Regent Baker noted that for the first time, nine other state public
universities had joined together in filing amicus briefs on behalf of the University
in a lawsuit.
There being no further discussion, Regent Brown moved that the Regents receive the reports. Regent Varner seconded the motion, and it was approved
unanimously.
Gifts and Grants
Vice President Cosovich submitted the gift report for fiscal year 1990-91, and
for the month of July 1991. President Duderstadt noted that in the coming year,
the University would embark on a new capital campaign, and that he was very encouraged by the early support and enthusiasm shown by a group of volunteers at
a meeting that had been held the previous week.


-48 -



September Meeting, 1991
With respect to the annual report, Regent Baker called attention to the spectacular success of the schools and colleges in obtaining contributions over a
five-year period. He asked that the gratitude of the Regents be expressed to the
schools and colleges for their efforts.
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
voted unanimously to receive the following gifts, with thanks, and in accord with

duties at Wayne County General Hospital, later changed to Westland Hospital,
from 1956-85. He transferred to the Department of Pathology at the University
of Michigan Medical Center in 1985 when the University programs closed at the
Westland Hospital facility.
Dr. Schmidt is one of the Department of Pathology's experts in the field of
cytopathology and gynecologic pathology. Both he and Dr. Bernard Taylor have
played an important role in the education of residents in the pathology clinical
program.
Dr. Schmidt has distinguished himself by his dedication to diagnostic and
consultative services in the Department of Pathology. His long years of
dedicated teaching of medical students and residents, as well as his highly effective role in clinical activities of the Department of Pathology, represent enduring
contributions that will have impacts for years to come.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Robert W. Schmidt Professor Emeritus of Pathology.
Jules A. Shafer, professor of biological chemistry, retired from active faculty
status on August 31, 1991, after a highly productive career as a teacher and scientific investigator.
A native of New York, Professor Shafer took undergraduate studies at the
City College of New York, where he received his B.Eng. degree in chemical engineering in 1959. He received his Ph.D. degree in chemistry from the Polytechnic
Institute of New York in Brooklyn in 1963.
After completing his doctoral studies, Professor Shafer accepted a position as
a postdoctoral fellow and tutor in the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University. He held that title until 1964, when he was named assistant professor of
biological chemistry at the University of Michigan. He was promoted to associate professor in 1969, and to full professor in 1977. He has been vigorous in
research and in teaching, has contributed significantly to the present strength of
the Department of Biological Chemistry, and is known internationally for his innovative research contributions in the areas of reaction mechanisms for enzymes
and protein-protein interactions.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scientist and health educator for
-74 -



September Meeting, 1991


his dedicated service by naming Jules A. Shafer Professor Emeritus of Biological
Chemistry.
Peter 0. Steiner, professor of economics and dean emeritus of the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, and professor of law in the Law School, retired
from active faculty status on August 31, 1991, after a remarkably productive
career as a scholar, teacher, researcher, and administrator.
Born in New York City, Professor Steiner received his A.B. degree, magna
cum laude, from Oberlin College in 1943. After serving in the U.S. Navy during
World War II, Professor Steiner received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from
Harvard University in 1949 and 1950, respectively. He taught at the University of
California at Berkeley from 1949-57, and at the University of Wisconsin from
1957-68. In 1968, he joined the University of Michigan faculty as professor of
economics and professor of law.
At Michigan, Professor Steiner was instrumental, both in the classroom and
as chair of the Department of Economics, in revising the core graduate and undergraduate economics courses. He also taught industrial organization at the
graduate and undergraduate levels. In the Law School, he was instrumental in
developing the law and economics program and the joint degree program in law
and economics. He also taught antitrust law, including detailed analysis of legal
procedures.
Professor Steiner's research in economics has spanned a number of fields.
His early work was largely on theory and method; his latest on law and economics. In between, and throughout his career, his work has generally been concerned with connections between economic analysis and public policy, broadly
construed. His most famous theoretical work, on the problem of peak-load pricing of public utilities, addresses a very practical problem, and has affected the
way in which public utility pricing is undertaken. Virtually all of his published
work is of both academic and more practical interest. In this, and in his lively
interest and engagement in his colleagues' and his students' work, he has
exemplified the best traditions of the economics department and the Law School.
Professor Steiner chaired the economics department from 1971-74, and
served as dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts from 1981-89.
He was president of the American Association of University Professors from
1976-78, and has held numerous other distinguished posts, both within and without the University. He brought to the administration the same combination of
intellectual power and appreciation of practical necessity that typify his academic
work.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his many contributions to the University of Michigan by naming Peter 0. Steiner Professor
Emeritus of Law, Professor Emeritus of Economics, and Dean Emeritus.
Memorials
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously adopted the following memorial statement:
The Regents of the University acknowledge with profound sadness the death
of Gary N. Davidoff, M.D., director of research and assistant professor of physical
medicine and rehabilitation.
Dr. Davidoff died at his home in Ann Arbor on August 29, 1991, after a long
illness. A 1981 graduate of Wayne State University School of Medicine, he
completed his residency in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Northwestern


-75 -



September Meeting, 1991


University and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago in 1984. In 1986, he
received his M.S. degree in clinical research design and statistical analysis from
the University of Michigan School of Public Health.
Dr. Davidoff had a spectacular, although brief career in physiatry. He joined
the University of Michigan faculty as an instructor of physical medicine and rehabilitation in 1985, and rapidly progressed through the academic ranks. In May
1991, the Regents approved Dr. Davidoffs promotion to associate professor of
physical medicine and rehabilitation, with tenure. In his shortened career, he
published over 30 papers on chronic pain, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain
injury; was principal investigator on many externally funded scientific investigations; and received a National Institutes of Health Clinical Investigator Development Award. His strengths as a researcher in medical rehabilitation were
marked not only by his accomplishments in the Department of Physical Medicine
and Rehabilitation at the University of Michigan, where he served as director of
research, but also at the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration Medical Center,
where he was chief of rehabilitation medicine until 1990. His expertise was further recognized through his collaborative studies with colleagues at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, the Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan, Ben Gurian
University of the Negev, and the Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel. Shortly before his death, Dr. Davidoff was honored by receiving a
Fulbright Lectureship Award to pursue his research in Israel.
A tireless worker on behalf of academic goals in the field of medical rehabilitation, Dr. Davidoff was associate editor of Rehabilitation of Neurologic
Disabilities and NeuroRehabilitation: An Interdisciplinary Journal As a teacher, he
was sought out and praised by residents and medical students, and as a mentor,
he was an advocate and advisor to many faculty, trainees, and students. As a clinician, Dr. Davidoff demonstrated his versatility with patients in the full range of
physiatric settings â€”inpatients, outpatients, consultations, and in the electrodiagnostic laboratory.
Dr. Davidoff will be sorely missed by those who knew and loved him. The
communities of medical rehabilitation and academic medicine are lessened by his
departure. Our condolences go to his wife Karen, their children, Shira, Zvi, and
Noam; his parents, Ronald and Rita Davidoff of Oak Park, Michigan; and his
brother, Mark Davidoff of West Bloomfield, Michigan.

September Meeting, 1991


Water Street Renovation Project
Chancellor Jones informed the Regents that the State Building Authority had
not yet sold the bonds intended to provide $1.9 million of the cost of the Water
Street Pavilion Renovation Project. This $1.9 million was to be used to pay off
the Mott Foundation mortgage on the pavilion and serve as the source of the
grant money from the Mott Foundation to the University to finish the renovation
of the pavilion.
Due to the need for access to the capital outlay during the renovation of the
pavilion, the Mott Foundation has agreed to extend its $1.9 million grant to the
University prior to receiving payment from the State Building Authority. Because of restrictions concerning Mott's grant process, the University has agreed
to repay this grant to Mott, if State Building Authority financing is not available
by December 15, 1991. Should that occur, Chancellor Jones reported that funds
had been identified to cover this repayment. However, it is not anticipated that
this will be necessary, since the State Building Authority expects funding to be in
place before that deadline.
1055 Wall Street, Ann Arbor
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved purchase of the property at 1055 Wall Street, Ann Arbor,
at a price of $95,000.

unanimously approved acceptance of Lot 652 of Lost Canyon No. 2 Subdivision,
Morton Township, Mecosta County, Michigan, as described in the Regents communication.
Saux Head Point Association Properties
Regent Brown moved acceptance of offers for parcels 2 and 3 in the Saux
Head Point Association development, as described in the Regents communication. Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Veterans Administration Hospital Easement
In conjunction with a project to install a North Campus duct bank for the
telecommunications department, the Veterans Administration Hospital has requested a 12-foot easement for installing and servicing the cable that will be located in a 4-inch duct that is part of this project.
Regent McFee moved approval of the easement as described; Regent Power
seconded the motion. Regent Nielsen asked why the University was not giving a
license for use of the property instead of an easement in perpetuity, so that the
University would have more control over it. In response to a comment by Regent
Baker, it was agreed that a graphic depiction of the area in question would be
presented the following day. Following further discussion, Regent Brown moved
approval of the easement, subject to the understanding that if it were feasible to




September Meeting, 1991


grant a license rather than an easement, this would be done, but otherwise, to
approve it as described in the Regents' communication. Regent Power seconded
the motion, and it was adopted unanimously.
Cancer and Geriatrics Center
Regent Baker observed that the Regents had received a communication from
Vice President Womack about progress that had been made in the design of the
Cancer and Geriatrics Center, with input by Carl Johnson as the Regents' representative. He pointed out that the fenestration and the massing of the building
on top of the parking structure still needed further review.
There followed a short recess, after which the meeting reconvened in the
Anderson Room of the Michigan Union to hear public comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Charles Zeeman, citizen, about his grandson's residency status; Lisa
Sorenson, member of Citizens for Safe Waste Disposal, about the North Campus
incinerator and radioactive and toxic waste handling facility; Karen L. Braun,
Bryan Berry, Reuben Rubio, Harold M. Martins, and Naomi L. Kirshner, residents of family housing, about family housing eligibility requirements; Neil D.
Smith, student, and Thomas Oko, president of Graduate Employees Organization (GEO), about GEO contract negotiations.
Friday, September 20, 1991
The Regents met at 9:00 A.M. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner,
and Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Johnson, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were
Chancellors Jones and Wilson. Vice President Swain was absent.
Veterans Administration Hospital Easement
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Vice President Womack to-respond to concerns raised the previous day regarding the Veterans Administration Hospital easement. Vice President Womack stated that the
University would attempt to negotiate a license instead of a lease. He then
called on Mr. Fred Mayer, university planner, who displayed drawings illustrating
what is involved in the duct work and easement.
Mr. Mayer and Vice President Womack responded to comments from the
Regents.
Engineering College Library Move to North Campus
Vice President Womack described a proposal to move the Engineering College library collections from the Undergraduate Library to a temporary location
-78 -



September Meeting, 1991


in the Dow Building on North Campus. The collection would remain there until
completion of the Integrated Technology Instruction Center (ITGC) building.
Following some discussion, Regent Smith moved, Regent Varner seconded,
and the Regents unanimously approved, proceeding with the project as described
in the Regents communication.
Randall Laboratory Addition
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents unanimously approved appointment of the firm of Luckenbach/Ziegelman and Partners as architects for the Randall Laboratory addition and proceeding with the
project as described.
Space Research Building Addition
The Regents were informed that a contract for the Space Research Building
addition had been awarded to the low bidder, J. M. Olson Company.

unanimously approved the following projects: Laboratory renovations for the
Department of Anatomy in the Medical Science Building II; boiler replacement
in the Space Research Building; renovation in the Buhr Building to house Federal Accounting; and installation of a voice controlled door access system in selected buildings in the Medical Center.
Regental Ordinance
Vice President Womack noted that when the Regents approved the Regental
Ordinance at the July meeting, they made a number of suggestions. The document now before the Regents is the final form of the completed document for
confirmation of the new wording. This new wording includes all changes approved at the July meeting, as well as inclusion of all appropriate clauses from
the previously referenced Ann Arbor city ordinances, which are now not included
by reference.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the final wording of the Regental Ordinance. The text of
the ordinance can be found in the appendix following these minutes.
Proposed Research Subcontract between the University of Michigan and EP
Systems
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent McFee, all six regents
present unanimously approved a subcontract between the University of Michigan
and EP Systems (Regents Baker and Brown were away from the table when the
vote was taken). Because the owner of EP Systems, Janice Jenkins, is also an
employee of the University, this contract falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance
with statutory requirements:


-79 -



September Meeting, 1991


1.  Parties to the agreement will be EP Systems and the Regents of
the University of Michigan.
2.  The proposed agreement is a standard University research contract. There are no restrictions on publication or openness of the
research. The project involves the evaluation by the GSRA of
software previously developed by EP Systems. Testing of the software will be done using clinical data already stored by Dr. Jenkins
in the Medical School Computing Laboratory of the electrical engineering and computer science department or to be obtained by
EP Systems during its conduct of the Phase II study.
The subcontract will provide 25 percent research assistant
support, related fringe benefits, supplies, and indirect cost (on
campus research rate of 57 percent) over a twelve-month period.
Dr. Jenkins will supervise the project and act as project director.
The total amount of the subcontract is $13,500.
3.  During the academic year, Dr. Jenkins will be reimbursed for her
time on the project as an employee of the company. This salary
will not exceed 20 percent of Dr. Jenkins' University salary. Dr.
Jenkins owns one-half of the company. EP Systems will retain all
rights to the software which it previously developed and which is
being tested in this project.
School of Dentistry's Faculty Practice
The Regents were informed that the School of Dentistry have changed the
name of the Dental Service Plan to the Dental Faculty Associates.
Correction of Academic Calendar for Winter 1992 and Spring-Summer 1992,

the winter and spring-summer terms of 1992, as described in the Regents communication.
Academic Calendar Revision for Fall 1991, UM-Flint
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved a revision in the fall 1991 academic calendar at UM-Flint,
as described in the Regents communication.
Definition of Family for Housing Eligibility
Regent Nielsen observed that several of the speakers at the previous day's
Public Comments session had expressed concern about a possible change in the
definition of "family" for purposes of eligibility for family housing. He said he
was concerned that an orgamnzation had misrepresented a report as having been
University-sponsored. He also expressed concern that such a report had emanated from the Affirmative Action Office, and said that more control might have


-80 -



September Meeting, 1991


been exerted over that office to prevent it from having purveyed the misleading
information.
Regent Nielsen stated that he did not think it appropriate to change the definition of what constitutes a family unit, and that the Regents ought to send a
message that it should remain the same. He then offered the following resolution:
'The University of Michigan Board of Regents reaffirms the existing eligibility
requirements for family housing."
Regent Smith stated that she wholeheartedly supported Regent Nielsen's
resolution and seconded the motion.
Regent Power questioned whether adoption of this resolution would cut off
the ordinary managerial and administrative processes that the Housing Division
uses to set rules and eligibility requirements for various kinds of University housing.
Regent Waters observed that it might be preferable for the Board to state
that the Housing Division could not make any changes without coming to the
Board for approval. The policy would stay as it is unless the Regents approve a
change.
Regent Nielsen stated that he thought it was necessary to make this statement now because of the disruption this issue is causing in family housing units.
He reiterated that a report had come from the Affirmative Action Office that
gave the impression it was University-sponsored, when it was not. It was clarified
that there were two reports, one that had come from the Affirmative Action
Office, and a second that had come from Student Legal Services, the latter of
which had been the subject of public comments.
Regent Nielsen then noted that Student Legal Services was funded from student fees, and that perhaps there ought to be a negative budget proration to
reduce student fees going to pay for this type of lobbying by Student Legal Services.
Regent Waters moved to table this issue until the next meeting, so that
more information could be obtained. Regent Baker stated that he did not think
more information was needed. The motion to table e died for lack of a second.
Regent Nielsen reiterated that he felt it was important for the Regents to
send a message that the study by the Affirmative Action Office had not been authorized by the Board, and that his resolution merely reaffirmed the policies already in place.
Regent Brown stated his view that unless someone made a motion to
change the currently existing guidelines, it would be inappropriate procedurally
to do anything. Regent McFee said that she did feel a statement from the Board
was necessary, and that regardless of the source, the implication was that this is
something the University is contemplating, and this has created a great deal of
concern. She felt it appropriate that it be stated that no change is pending.


-81 -



September Meeting, 1991


Regent Varner questioned how the housing office had been responding.
Regent Baker stated his understanding that housing is backing a similar motion
to that offered by Student Legal Services. He observed that this is part of a frontal attack on changing the definition of a family, and thought it is important that
the University be on record to state that it does support the traditional family.
Regent Brown pointed out that such an action might lead to procedural
problems, where the Regents would be called upon monthly to reaffirm actions
they have already taken. He felt it should be clear to the public that no Regents
were proposing that the policy be changed in any way. Regent Baker observed
that he felt the effect would be just the opposite; not passing a resolution would
be encouragement to go forward with the change.
Regent Power noted that the institution of public comments is becoming an
institution in which issues are raised which cause the Board to put itself in a position where it has to respond instantly to issues that are raised at Public Comments sessions. People who are skilled in political theater are going to raise various policy issues at Public Comments sessions repeatedly, each time triggering an
immediate Board response to the problems that are raised in that manner. So
the question is how the Board can make its policy judgments clear and at the
same time not engage in micromanagement.
Regent Nielsen pointed out that this issue did not arise from public comments, but rather, from a study issued by the Affirmative Action Office which was
not officially authorized by the institution. This leaves the impression that the
proposal under question was proposed by the University, and that is why he felt it
is important to address the issue now.
Regent Power suggested holding any action for a month to give the Regents
a chance to read the report. Regent Brown reiterated his opinion that even
though he agreed with the intent ofRegent Nielsen's motion, it was not necessary
procedurally to reaffirm an existing policy. As to whether or not the affirmative
action report was sanctioned by the University, that was a matter for the president and administration to deal with.
Regent McFee stated that she felt it would be appropriate for the Regents
to assert that changing family housing eligibility rules was not under
consideration by the Regents. Regent Varner stated her agreement with Regent
Brown that as a procedural matter, it was not necessary to reaffirm an existing
policy, although she would support a statement that until some other action is
taken the definition would stay the same.
Regent Baker pointed out that in the past, issues have been raised at Public
Comments that were later acted on by the Board, including investment in South
Africa and SDI. Regarding the affirmative action report on the status of lesbians
and gay men, Regent Baker commented that he had been criticized in the report
because of his personal religious beliefs. He stated that he was offended by this
and did not think it appropriate for a University publication to attack a Regent
for his religious beliefs. He also noted that Regent Power had been mentioned
in this report in a more favorable light, as somewhat of a folk hero, and that perhaps other Regents had as well. Regent Baker concluded that to have public
money used for specific narrow-focus issues constitutes inappropriate expenditure of public funds.


-82 -



September Meeting, 1991


Regents Brown and Power reiterated their belief that even though the Regents might agree with the substance of the motion, as a procedural matter, it was
inappropriate for the Regents to take action reaffirming an existing policy.
Regent Power also pointed out that the Regents had not seen the reports that are
the subject of the discussion.
It was decided to take a short recess.
Following the recess, Regent McFee introduced the following substitute
motion:
The Regents have considered the question of the eligibility policy concerning
family housing and find no need to change it We further direct that a copy of this
statement be sent to the director of housing.
Regent Nielsen stated that this substitute motion was acceptable to him
Regent Power commented that although this motion was superior to the original
motion, he felt it was premature, because it assumed that the Regents had read
reports that they had not read. Because he could not make an informed vote, he
sad he would therefore abstain from voting.
Regent Brown stated that he did not consider the motion to have anything
to do with the reports; the motion was simply in response to remarks at the
Public Comments session by people who live in married student housing.
There being no further discussion, the vote was taken and the motion
carried, with Regents Baker, Brown, Nielsen, McFee, Smith, Varner, and Waters
in favor and Regent Power abstaining.
Presidential Salary
Regent Brown then made a recommendation to the Board that the President's salary be increased by 5.5 percent for the current fiscal year, for a total of
$180,385. He praised the president and his wife, Anne, for the tremendous effort
that both had expended on behalf of the University, noting that the position of
university president is a "very, very tough job" and the increase is well-deserved.
Regent Nielsen supported the motion and observed that because of the extensive effort made by Anne Duderstadt, the Regents ought to consider some
kind of compensation for her as well. Regent Brown responded that he would be
happy to work with the Board to come up with some alternatives for doing this.
Regents Varner and Smith also expressed their support for the recommendation. The vote was then taken on the salary recommendation, and the motion
carried unanimously.
Regent Brown then read the following statement on behalf of the Regents.
Regents' Statement Concerning Indirect and Direct Overhead Costs for Federally Funded Research Projects
The Regents of the University of Michigan are deeply concerned over the allegations of improper research overhead cost allocation recently disclosed in the media.


-83 -



September Meeting, 1991


The Regents and the administration constantly work, on behalf of the people of
Michigan, to protect the integrity of the University. Even a '.perceived" compromise
of that integrity is a matter of serious concern to the Regents. But everyone should be
clear that at no time does the HHS audit report allege or suggest that any funds were
misspent by the University. The proper expenditure of the people's money has the
Regents' highest priority.
All University expenditures including research overhead charges, undergo multiple levels of audit, both internal and external In addition, the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS) has annually audited the University research
allocations since 1956 Some costs are allowed, some are not allowed. The final
allocation of costs has always been a matter of good faith and arms length
negotiation.
The real issue is to make sure that the legitimate overhead costs of running the
University are allocated fairly and within government guidelines between a cost pool
that relates to research and a cost pool that relates to instruction. It is important for
the people of Michigan to realize that if the federal government is going to change the
rules which govern how costs are allocated between research and instruction cost
pools or arbitrarily to put a cap on the percent of indirect cost overhead charged for
research, it is Michigan taxpayers and students and families who pay tuition who will
pick up the bill It may or may not be legitimate for the federal government to try to
shift the costs of doing contract research from Washington to the state universities.
But it needs to be made quite clear who will pay if costs are shifted.
The Michigan congressional delegation should be advised by the University administration of the importance of clearly defining educational costs and research
costs in the research overhead equation.
The Regents, of course, strongly believe that universities are accountable and
should properly and appropriately expend federal and state research dollars. The
University will now turn its attention to resolving those differences, clarifying the relevant federal guidelines and modifying its own procedures where appropriate We are
confident that the University's integrity will be maintained throughout this process.
Whatever the outcome of this current and important national debate on
funding federal research, the Congress must recognize that the public research
universities of this country are one of the great engines of the American economy and
vast contributors to the public good
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting is scheduled for October 17 and 18, 1991. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses for the months of July and
August, 1991, totalled $4,455.50 and $142.59, respectively.

OCTOBER MEETING, 1991


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, October 17, 1991
The Regents met at 2:00 P.M. in the Michigan Room of the Harding Mott
University Center at the University of Michigan-Flint. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, and
Varner. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Kelly, Swain, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones and Wilson. Regent Waters and Vice President Johnson were absent.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Provost
Whitaker to present the 1992-93 state budget request for the Ann Arbor campus.
1992-93 State Budget Request, Ann Arbor Campus
Provost Whitaker began with a slide presentation that illustrated some of the
public service activities associated with the Ann Arbor campus. He noted that
because these service activities emerge from and are closely connected to instructional and research programs, the strength of these programs is essential, not only
for their direct benefits, but also as a foundation for the programs of service to
the people of Michigan.
There are three components to the University's budget request for 1992-93.
The first is based on the expected inflationary increase of 5 percent in the Higher
Education Price Index (HEPI). Based on the 1991-92 base appropriation, this
would equal $12.9 million.
The second component is related to the operation and maintenance of physical facilities and totals $6.8 million. Operating costs for facilities openings m FY
1993 are projected to be $.9 million, and there is a carry-forward from previously
underfunded operating costs of $2.5 million, for a total request for facilities openings of $3.4 million. The remainder of the physical facilities request, $3.4 million,
is for special maintenance funding to make up for some of the capital outlay
funds that in past years have been appropriated and subsequently rescinded.
The third component of the request consists of $2.1 million for critical academic needs. These include multidisciplinary problem-based studies; expansion
of programs designed to increase the numbers of under-represented minorities
among students and faculty and to encourage the hiring of senior women faculty;
additional resources for financial aid to offset reduced federal support; and improving the international component of all educational programs. A substantial
portion of the funds required or critical academic needs will come from internal
reallocations or from growth in other revenue.
Altogether, the proposed incremental increase in state appropriation for
1992-93 totals $21.8 million. Provost Whitaker noted that the University recognizes that it will be difficult for the state to grant this request, but pointed out


-127 -



October Meeting, 1991


that the University continues to increase the quality and efficiency of its operations through reallocation, cost containment, and Total Quality Management efforts. As evidence of its success in these areas, he pointed out that U.S. News and
World Report had recently ranked the University 37th in resources, but 11th in
overall academic reputation, indicating the University makes prudent use of the
funding available to it.
The president then called on Chancellor Wilson to present the state budget
request for the Dearborn campus.
1992-93 State Budget Request, Dearborn Campus
Chancellor Wilson noted that the UM-Dearbom budget request was heavily
influenced by the strategic planning process of the past 1Y2 years, and thus reflects
three priorities: continuing to provide the highest quality education, insuring that
its facilities are adequately serviced and maintained, and expanding external
partnerships to insure the future economic and educational competitiveness of
metropolitan Detroit and the state of Michigan.
The incremental budget request for UM-Dearborn totals $1,893,000. It includes the following components: inflation estimate of 5 percent ($927,000); new
space operating costs ($348,000); a portion of the $1.7 million backlog in deferred maintenance funding ($340,000); and community service endeavors for expanding partnerships with business, industry, public schools, and other areas
($278,000).
1992-93 State Budget Request, Flint Campus
Chancellor Jones reported that the 1992-93 incremental budget request, like
that of the other campuses, is very modest in deference to the tight state revenue
situation. It includes an inflationary component based on the expected HEPI of 5
percent ($830,300); the remainder of the new facilities operating costs necessary
for the operation of the renovated University Pavilion ($392,000); and 5 program
initiatives. The program initiatives include minority recruitment and retention
($100,000); information technology services ($100,000); academic program enhancements ($250,000); library acquisitions ($100,000); and science building
equipment maintenance ($50,000). The total incremental budget request for the
Flint campus is $1,822,300.
Chancellor Jones distributed a handout of statistical information about
Flint's student population and funding history. With 72 percent of its students residing in Genesee County, he noted that UM-Flint is the most regional of all of
Michigan's public universities, and that the University enjoys a very close relationship with the city of Flint. Because of the significant growth in its enrollment
over the past 10 years, UM-Flint has gone from one of the better funded institutions in terms of FYES to one of the poorest funded.
In the discussion that followed, Regent Baker pointed out the heavy emphasis on all three campuses on public service activities that benefit the communities
in which they exist.


-128 -



October Meeting, 1991


In response to a question from Regent Nielsen, Chancellor Jones stated that
state appropriation and tuition are the major sources of funding for the Flint
campus operating budget. If the state appropriation is decreased, either tuition
would have to be increased or programs would have to be cut. Regent Nielsen
suggested investigating other sources of revenue, such as service activities, that
might be used in the future to enhance the operating budget.
Regent Power asked Provost Whitaker how the budget proposal affects the
quality of the institution's programs, as well as its infrastructure and activities
necessary to sustain the quality of the faculty and the student body. Provost
Whitaker responded that the budget is basically at a standstill. Cost increase
avoidance measures, such as Total Quality Management, are being undertaken.
Rather than being designed to save costs, the goal of these programs is to improve quality using the existing levels of resources, thereby avoiding increased
costs.
President Duderstadt noted that over the past year, public higher education
has experienced a serious erosion in tax dollar support, so that it is increasingly
being supported through a combination of tuition and private support, much like
private higher education.
Following further comments, Regent Nielsen moved approval of the 1992-93
state budget requests for all three campuses. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
UM-Flint Library/Learning Resources Building
President Duderstadt called on Chancellor Jones, who announced that Mr.
Fred Mayer, university planner, would present the schematic design for the UMFlint Library/Learning Resources Building. Mr. Mayer noted that following the
acquisition of the Water Street Pavilion in the fall of 1990, review of the originally approved site was undertaken, and in February 1991, the Regents approved
a site relocation of the Library/Learning Resources Building to the riverfront
campus. This required a redesign of the original plan for the building, which the
architect had completed in conjunction with the University's planning consultants, Johnson Johnson & Roy/inc.
Mr. Mayer called on Mr. Richard Rigterink, of Johnson Johnson & Roy/inc,
who noted the importance of the library's design fitting in with the overall
campus framework and with the particular site. Another goal is to draw the river
front into the campus area so that the campus itself becomes a part of the waterfront open space system.
Regent Baker pointed out the importance of the University's ultimate goal of
acquiring the state office building, full ownership of the parking structure, and acquiring the nearby surface parking lot operated by the city. Mr. Rigterink agreed
that both of these are important areas of special interest to the Flint campus and
are included in the master plan.. They visually appear to be a part of the campus,
even though they are not, and they offer the opportunity for the University to
consolidate land holdings in the long-term future, should that become appropriate.


-129 -



October Meeting, 1991


In response to comments from Regents Power and Nielsen, Mr. Rigterink
mentioned that another parcel, currently owned by United Way, is also of interest to the University. Another property on the south side of the river, Autoworld,
has a visual impact, but does not have a place in the University's current mission.
Mr. Rigterink then described the building site and turned the floor over to
Mr. Mayer, who used drawings and a three-dmensional model to describe the
building's proposed schematic design.
Following further discussion, Regent Baker moved approval of the schematic
design for the UM-Flint Library/Learning Resources Building, and complimented the staff and the architect on their work. Regent Smith seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regent Power noted that the same architect who designed this building had
also designed the Sports Services Building (Schembechler Hall) on the Ann
Arbor campus. The visual impact of the Flint building in relation to the surrounding buildings was much more pleasing. He requested that an exact sample
of the bricks and glazing and the anodized material to be used in the Library/
Learning Resources Buiding be brought to the Regents.
Naming of UM-Flint Library/Learning Resources Building
Chancellor Jones noted that Mrs. Frances Willson Thompson had made
many gifts for the eventual construction of a Flint campus library during her lifetime. Therefore he recommended that the library be named in her honor.
Regent Nielsen moved that the UM-Flint Library/Learning Resources Building
be named the Frances Willson Thompson Library.
Regent Nielsen observed that the Flint community has always been very
supportive of the Flint campus, and announced that the Regents appreciate the
support of the community and of the Thompson family. Regent Brown seconded
the motion, and it was adopted unanimously.
Oil and Gas Investment
Vice President Womack called on Mr. David Thurston, the University's investment advisor. Mr. Thurston distributed two handouts, one of which showed
that as of June 30, 1991, the University's endowment was ranked eighth of the
thirty largest endowments in higher education. The other handout described the
University's endowment strategy and its current asset allocation. The proposed
oil and gas investment would add a $5 million commitment to the oil and gas
area, which would bring the total commitment from 2.6 percent of the endowment to 3.6 percent. He also noted that the total value of the endowment had increased from $431.6 million on December 31, 1990, to $514.3 million on August
31, 1991, and Vice Presidents Womack and Cosovich and Mr. Norman Herbert,
investment officer, were recognized for their efforts.
Following further discussion of the proposed oil and gas investment, Regent
Power moved that a commitment of $5 million be made to RIMCO Partners,
L.P. IV from the University Endowment Fund. Regent Nielsen seconded the
motion, and it was approved, and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power,


-130 -



October Meeting, 1991


and Varner in favor and Regent Smith abstaining.
University of Michigan Policy on Sexual Harassment by Faculty and Staff
President Duderstadt stated that University staff had been reworking the
proposed policy on sexual harassment by faculty and staff in response to comments and suggestions that had been made when it had first been presented to
the Regents in June. He called on Provost Whitaker to present the revised draft
of the policy for information purposes.
Provost Whitaker called to the table Ms. E. Kay Dawson, assistant to the provost and primary author of the policy, and Ms. Elsa Cole, general counsel. The
provost observed that sexual harassment is a serious problem at the University of
Michigan. The proposed policy would provide an internal mechanism for resolving complaints as an alternative to the legal system and the courts, thereby limiting the University's exposure to damages in court. He noted that sexual harassment cases do not involve romance or mutual affection; the common element is
an abuse of power, trust, and authority.
Provost Whitaker noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously
agreed that sexual harassment is an unlawful form of sex discrimination, and
cited other laws that prohibit sexual harassment. The University's initial policy
was issued in 1980; since that time, members of the University community have
been able to pursue harassment complaints within the University structure, instead of going through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
or the courts. He cited two forms of sexual harassment recognized by the law:
quid pro quo harassment (e.g. conditioning employment or educational benefits
on sexual favors), and hostile environment harassment, which negatively affects
the emotional or psychological stability of workers or students. He then described in legal and monetary terms why and how the University can be held
liable for the conduct of employees who sexually harass their colleagues or students.
Provost Whitaker then enumerated the revisions that had been made in the
current draft of the policy in response to concerns that had been expressed by the
Regents. Regarding false accusations, he said that the data shows that the possibility of this is remote. He noted that most complaints are made informally and
that the complainants want only for the behavior to stop. When complaints warrant investigation, the process is managed with scrupulous confidentiality. If
cases cannot be substantiated, no action is taken against the accused, and under
existing Regental bylaws and Standard Practice Guide provisions, action can be
taken against people who make intentionally false accusations. He emphasized
that the major issue is to make sure that there is an environment that encourages
people who have complaints to come forward to get help, because the University's liability would increase if this is not the case.
Regarding the language on intention and effects, the wording had been
changed per Regent Waters' suggestion. He then addressed the issue of consensual relationships, where the concern is what happens when a relationship that
had appeared consensual at some point in time breaks apart. In this instance, the
policy directs that if a romantic relationship develops between a supervisor and


-131 -



October Meeting, 1991


an employee or student and faculty member, a way be found to remove the person in the supervisory or evaluative position from the decision-making role. He
noted that complaints are seldom raised unless such a relationship is terminated.
The Regents had also raised the question of due process. Provost Whitaker
noted that the policy contains the fundamental due process the law requires, and
he stated what the Supreme Court had determined to be required in the case of
employment relationships. The policy contains the same amount of due process
protection that is afforded University employees in other investigations that precede disciplinary action. In cases which result in a recommendation of dismissal
of a tenured faculty member or faculty member on a term contract in advance of
the expiration date, there is a substantial property interest in continued employment and more elaborate due process is provided by Bylaw 5.09.
Provost Whitaker concluded that the deans are very anxious to have a policy
in place, as a sense of uncertainty exists among faculty about this issue. He said it
was important to get a policy in place, so that we can prevent the public disclosure of these matters that would occur if they were to be litigated in federal
courts. He believed the policy would provide the informal mechanism that would
resolve the concerns of most people.
Regent Baker stated that he believed there ought to be a policy, but he was
not persuaded that due process protections provided to accused individuals were
strong enough. He then read from an article that had appeared in the Michigan
Daily and the Ann Arbor News, "Anita Hill Deserves Thanks for Speaking Out on
Harassment", written by Julie Steiner, coordinator of the University's Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC). Regent Baker observed that
Steiner had alleged that the Board of Regents was similar to the United States
Senate, in that the power structure consisted largely of white men. Regent Baker
pointed out that the Board in fact is made up of a Black man, a Black woman,
two white women, and only four white men, and that a person in Steiner's position should have been aware of this.
Regent Baker then detailed his interpretation of how the matter of the allegation of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas
would have been handled under the proposed University of Michigan policy.
Thomas initially would not have known the identity of the complainant and an informal hearing would have been held. If a formal hearing becomes necessary,
there is a greater degree of due process, but not as much as there would be in a
court of law. Also, the University of Michigan, with its considerable resources,
can be substituted for the complainant. In the event of a false claim, Mr. Thomas
would have had no relief except to bring a legal action against the complainant,
in which case the University would probably defend the complainant.
Regent Baker noted that tenured faculty members, under the doctrine of
property rights, do have extensive rights of due process, but that employees and
students do not. Regent Baker stated that he applies two tests to every issue that
comes before the Board: 1) the integrity of the process; and 2) the basic fairness
of the process itself. He noted that he would be happy to support a policy that
would protect women against sexual harassment, but that rather than taking the
minimal requirements of the law with respect to due process, the University


-132 -



October Meeting, 1991


should break new ground and add more due process protections in the interest of
fairness.
Provost Whitaker responded that there are several steps that could be taken.
These include a simple inquiry about what constitutes sexual harassment or just
reporting an incident in order to have someone to talk to about it (informal process), similar to the manner in which an employee might bring up any job-related
concern. In the latter case, advice would be given to the complainant as to how
to resolve the problem. If formal action becomes necessary, the accused person
is notified and an investigation takes place to ascertain the facts. Provost
Whitaker emphasized that most victims just want the behavior to stop. He noted
that the goal is to get a policy in place and then to do extensive training both for
the intake workers who would be receiving the complaints and for the University
at large. In the event that a penalty is imposed against the accused as a result of
the investigation, a more judicial-type process can be invoked or the accused
could choose to go to court. But the goal is to stay out of court and to get the behavior stopped.
Regent Varner stated her support for the policy, but expressed concerns
about units that have been moving forward with their own policies. Specifically,
she inquired whether these units have been receiving counsel and guidance from
the Office of the General Counsel. Counsel Cole responded that the units had
been receiving such guidance. She also noted that if the proposed policy were
adopted, the individual units' policies would have to be made consistent with that
policy on any points in which they might differ.
In response to a question from Regent Varner about the training to be provided to the intake workers, Provost Whitaker indicated that there would be extensive training and education for intake workers and others on campus once the
policy is instituted.
The meeting then recessed to hear public comments.
Public Comments
The Regents then heard comments from Carrie Brie, about the definition of
family for family housing purposes.
University of Michigan Policy on Sexual Harassment by Faculty and Staff
Following public comments, the meeting returned to a discussion of the proposed sexual harassment policy, with the provost, Ms. Dawson, and Ms. Cole responding to questions about specific provisions in the policy.
In response to a question from Regent Nielsen, Ms. Dawson stated that the
policy is not geographically specific; it addresses conduct that may occur within
the employment relationship regardless of site (such as on a field trip, professional conference, etc.). Location is one factor to be assessed in evaluating a
claim of sexual harassment.
Regent Nielsen also expressed concern about which offices would be charged
with administering the policy, and with the discretion that those offices would


-133 -



October Meeting 1991


have. Ms. Cole, Ms. Dawson, and Provost Whitaker also responded to Regent
Nielsen's comments about the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
policy; the treatment of consensual relationships in the policy vis-a-vis the incorporation of the 1986 Senate Assembly statement of principle concerning relationships between faculty and students; the monitoring of external business relationships as provided for in the existing nepotism policy; the consequences of romantic relationships between students and teaching assistants; and the complainthandling procedure.
Regent Smith expressed her support of the need for a policy. However, she
noted tat the policy seems t favor the complainant over the person being accused of harassment, which she believes is a orm of discrimination because the
person being accused would ou not be told of the accusation unless a formal complaint is pursued. In response to a suggestion by Regent Smith that the draft
policy be reviewed by Law School faculty, Ms. Cole responded that many Law
School faculty, including the dean, had already reviewed the policy. Regent
Smith said that she would feel more comfortable if the Law School would state in
writing that they had reviewed the policy.
Ms. Dawson observed that unlike what happened with the student disciminatory harassment policy, the sexual harassment policy is not breaking new
ground. Institutions all over the country have similar policies that address their
roles as employers. Provost Whitaker pointed out that the procedures set forth in
the policy have been tested in case law and in the Supreme Court, and Regent
Brown concurred.
Regent Baker reiterated that it was important that due process procedures
be spelled out in the policy at the outset.
Regent McFee observed that although it was important to respond to the
suggestions that had been made, it was also important to institute the policy as
soon as possible so that employees can seek relief from sexual harassment via a
confidential, internal system. She pointed out that not having any policy at all
put the University at greater risk than having a policy that may have some imperRegent Power stated that at the point where complaints change from informal to formal, a qualitative change occurs. He believed that the Office of the
General Counsel, rather than the Affirmative Action Office, should oversee the
process at that point. He also suggested that it be stated in the policy that
remedy for false accusations is covered through the University's internal grievance procedures.
Following further discussion, it was decided to recess the meeting until the
following day, with the hope that the policy could be revised sufficiently by that
time to be responsive to the Regents' concerns.
Friday, October 18, 1991
The Regents met at 10:00 A.M. in the Regents' Room. Present were President Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith,


-134 -



October Meeting, 1991


Varner, and Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy,
and Vice Presidents Cosovich, Johnson, Kelly, Swain, and Womack were also
present, as were Chancellors Jones and Wilson.
Announcements
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and announced that the
University of Michigan Business School's Executive Education Program had just
been named number one in the nation by Business Week magazine, and he recognized Provost Whitaker, under whose tenure as dean that program had been developed.
The president also announced that for the fall term 1991, the University had
the largest number of minority students of every ethnic group at every level of the
University in its history. Slightly over 20.0 percent of students enrolled on the
Ann Arbor campus are minority students, with 7e61 percent being African American. This is the largest number (2,510) of African American students that has
ever been enrolled. In addition, 64 new faculty of color were added to the University.
Ernst & Young Management Report and Responses
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Womack, who introduced Mr.
Robert Emde of Ernst & Young. Mr. Emde introduced Mr. Harold Miller, of
Ernst & Young, who has principle responsibility for audits of University Hospitals, MCare, the Dental Service Plans, and the Medical Service Plans; Mr.
George Johnson, principle of the George Johnson Company; and Mr. Ed Nolan,
of Ernst & Young, whose principle responsibility is coordinating the firm's work
with University Audits.
Mr. Emde stated that Ernst & Young's report on the financial statements
contained an unqualified opinion. The review of the internal control structure
disclosed no material weaknesses in controls or procedures. Mr. Emde further
commented that the management letter is intended to provide constructive statements to further strengthen the procedures and controls employed by the University, and that the University's responses to the recommendations are appropriate.
In the discussion that followed, Regent Baker asked whether Ernst & Young
was satisfied with the University's accounting for the state's "hold-back" of
previously-approved general fund appropriations. Mr. Emde responded that the
firm concurred with the accounting principles that are being followed. Regent
Baker also asked whether the firm had any suggestions regarding the University's
accounting practices related to indirect overhead research costs. Mr. Emde responded that he did not have any further comments. Finally, Regent Baker reminded the auditors that the Regents would be willing to meet with the auditors
privately on any matters of concern. Following further discussion about the
audit, the Regents turned to the remainder of the meeting agenda.
Minutes
Consideration of the minutes of the September 1991 meeting was delayed
until the following month.


-135 -



October Meeting, 1991


Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports on Investment Transactions, Plant
Extension, Endowment Fund Quarterly Inventory, Litigation, and Non-Competitive Purchases Over $2,000.
In response to a question from Regent Baker about a litigation matter involving a bicyclist, Vice President Womack stated that there is no thought being given
to prohibit bicycles on campus. Regent Baker noted that as a frequent campusarea pedestrian himself, he is aware that accommodating both bicyclists and pedestrians n the campus area creates a challenge.
Vice President Womack then responded to other questions about the reports. Regent Power noted that the volume of non-competitive purchases had
declined substantially over the past few years, and commended Vice President
Womack for his successful efforts in this area
Vice President Kelly submitted reports of Projects Established â€”Research
and Other Academic Activities and Summaries of a Selection of Current Research and Sponsored Projects. Then, there being no further discussion, Regent
Brown moved, Regent Smith seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved
receipt of the reports.

Rankin, Anita J. Peters, and Ketan M. Trivedi ("Professor Sacks and Employees") are also employees of the University of Michigan, this agreement falls
under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and
Chromatofast, a corporation in which Professor Richard D. Sacks,
Mark A. Klemp, Christine L Rankin, Anita J. Peters, and Ketan
M. Trivedi own stock.
2. Terms of the contract include: a duration for the term of the last
to expire of the licensed patents, and consideration to the University consisting of: a $2,000 license issue fee; payment of royalties,
including minimum royalties, on products utzing the technology;
a share of sublicensing revenues received by Chromatofast; and reimbursement of past and future University patent filing and prosecution costs for the technology. Royalties will be paid to the University at a rate of 4 percent for products sold by Chromatofast
which are covered by one or more patents, and 2 percent for products sold which are covered by know-how. Chromatofast will pay
the University 30 percent of its sublicensing revenues but will not
be required to pay the University a share of revenue received for
continuing research and development by Chromatofast. Minimum
royalties shall commence during the third year of the agreement at
$10,000 and progress each year thereafter to $50,000 in the seventh
and each subsequent year. The University retains ownership of all
technology. The University retains the right to use such technology for research, teaching, and other educationally-related purposes. Chromatofast shall diligently pursue the commercial development and exploitation of the technology covered by the proposed license agreement. There is no use of facilities or services of
the University included in the contract and no assignment of University employees for fulfillment of the contract.
These terms are the same as originally approved, with the exception that the non-exclusively licensed patent is now licensed exclusively, and the reduced royalty rate for that patent has been deleted.
3. Professor Sacks and Employees' pecuniary interest in the contract
arises from their stock ownership, currently consisting of 100 percent of Chromatofast's total authorized shares, which total 5,000
shares of common voting stock. Professor Sacks and Employees'
equity interest will be in lieu of participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University in accordance with University
policy.

Chancellor Wilson reported that the propsed closure of the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies and the two items which follow represent an attempt by
the Dearborn campus to ty to clarify its priorities and achieve cost efficiencies,
while at the same time enhancing the quality of its academic programs. She
noted that with the exception of the undergraduat degree in public administration, no programs would be eliminated by this action. The existing programs are
being relocated into the appropriate schools and colleges, where they will be administered by the existing deans and executive committees.
Following some discussion, Regent Varner moved, Regent Brown seconded,
and the Regents unanimously approved, closure of the Division of Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and transfer of the degree
programs developed within that division to the appropriate schools and colleges.
Transfer of the Public Administration Program at UM-Dearborn to the School of

October Meeting, 1991


University of Michigan Policy on Sexual Harassment by Faculty and Staff
President Duderstadt reported that modifications had been made to the
policy draft in response to Regents' comments the previous day.
Provost Whitaker reviewed the changes that had been made. These include
a statement referring to disciplinary procedures that already exist to address the
filing of false complaints; shortening the section on consensual relationships so
that other documents are not incorporated by reference; explicitly referring to
the involvement of the Office of the General Counsel in the formal investigation
stage; the addition of a sentence stating that steps would be taken to restore the
reputation of an accused person if allegations are not substantiated; clarification
of the section describing the circumstances under which the University would
assume the role of complainant; change in the language regarding who might accompany a person to an investigation; and addition of a statement that the
complaint-handling guidelines will be approved by the Office of the Provost and
the Office of the General Counsel.
Regent Nielsen stated that it was important to have a policy, and suggested
that an interim policy be adopted that would include a sunset clause stating the
policy would terminate in six months, providing this policy incorporate his recommendations for further revision. Regent Nielsen stated he disagreed with several
aspects of the consensual relationships section, and suggested corrections that he
would find acceptable. He asked for several clarifications about the existing disciplinary systems and grievance procedures. In the section about reporting requirements, Regent Nielsen objected to the Office of Affirmative Action being
designated to monitor repeated complaints within the same unit or against the
same individual. Regent Nielsen also commented about the language in the
"General" section that states who may accompany a person to a proceeding and
what that person's role should be. Finally, Regent Nielsen stated that besides
being approved by the Offices of the Provost and the General Counsel, he felt
the complaint handling guidelines should also be approved by the Board of Regents.
In response to a question from Regent Baker, Ms. Cole stated that the role
of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center is to provide confidential
counseling; they do not receive official complaints. She also described, in response to, questions from Regent Baker, how the policy is applied with respect to
faculty members as opposed to other University employees, and noted that students are covered not by this policy, but by the Interim Policy on Discrimination
and Discriminatory Conduct by Students in a University Environment.
Regarding the latter policy, Regent Baker observed that he had been critical
of it since its inception and did not think it should exist. He quoted from an article in The American Spectator, written by University of Michigan professor
Joseph Adelson, that is critical of the "political correctness" movement. Regent
Baker mentioned that in the future he may move to end the interim student
policy, and pointed out that policies such as this have become highly controversial. Because of this, Regent Baker stated that he would like the Sexual Harassment Policy to include students, rather than have them covered by the interim
policy on discrimination and discriminatory conduct. He also observed that there
are various levels of due process for the various levels of University staff, and


-151 -



October Meeting, 1991


that he believed that every level of employee should have extensive due process
rights. Regent Baker expressed support for Regent Nielsen's suggestion that the
sexual harassment policy be terminated in six months and reviewed, and reiterated his belief that student conduct should be covered by this policy, rather than
by the interim policy.
Ms. Cole responded that the faculty and staff policy is supported by a welldeveloped body of case law covering the employment relationship. But there is
no equivalent body of case law to provide guidance in the student-to-student situation. This policy is intended to address what is known today, without question,
to be in violation of the law; to include the student arena, in which law is still developing, would complicate the issue. While it is certain that the faculty and staff
policy would stand up in court, there are more uncertainties in the other area, so
that a policy covering students will take longer to develop. Regent Baker stated
that he does not accept the inclusion of sexual harassment policy within the interim student policy on discrimination and discriminatory conduct.
Regent Brown commented that there could never be a policy addressing student conduct that would be acceptable to students. However, the policy under
question addresses an entirely separate issue: sexual harassment by faculty and
staff. He observed that this policy is sensible and needed, and he felt they ought
to move ahead with it.
In response to a question from Regent Brown, Ms. Dawson explained that
the statement in the Consensual Relationships section that "sexual relations...
are a basic violation of professional ethics and responsibility when the faculty
member has any professional responsibility for the students' academic performance..." is a statement of principle by the University faculty on this issue. Ms.
Dawson stated that this langage had een included in every version of the policy
with no objections from the faculty. Regent Brown stated he did not disagree
with this language being included in the policy. Regent Brown also stated he
would be hesitant to change other language in this section that Regent Nielsen
had objected to, since it had been approved by the Senate Assembly.
Regent Brown also stated that the mere fact that a professor becomes romantically involved with a student, whether or not they have any academic relationship, is a legitimate matter of concern for the policy to address. Regents
Nielsen and Brown then exchanged points of view on the consensual relationships portion of the policy. Regarding the reporting requirements section,
Regent Brown stated he did have some concerns that he may address at some
future time.
With respect to Regent Nielsen's suggestion that this policy be approved as
an interim policy, Regent Brown noted that any policy adopted by the Board
could be revised at any time; thus he did not think this was necessary. He concluded that it was important for the Board to adopt the policy soon to send a
message to the University community that the Regents recognize the need for it.
Regent McFee agreed with Regent Brown that it was important to move forward with the policy now, and that the policy as revised provides a climate for
bringing forth sexual harassment concerns in an accessible and confidential
manner. She stated she felt having a policy was important for both the victims


-152 -



October Meeting, 1991


and perpetrators of sexual harassment. She stated her intention to move adoption of the policy, but offered a change in last sentence of the "Reporting Requirements" section, removing the Office of Affirmative Action from having the
responsibility for monitoring repeated complaints. She moved adoption of the
polcy with the inclusion of Regent Nielsen's suggestion that it be adopted for six
months, at which time the policy would be reviewed and re-adopted to reflect the
experience with it up to that time.
Regent McFee accepted a request from Regent Nielsen that her motion include a proviso that language be added to the "General" section stating that a
person could designate a representative who can participate in the proceedings
and appear in his or her absence or inability to attend.
Ms. Cole stated that such a provision would allow an attorney to take charge
of the proceeding, and that this would create an inconsistency, since this practice
is not currently permitted in any other misconduct procedures in the investigative
stage. There followed a discussion about the advisability of allowing attorneys to
represent employees in investigatory proceedings, and about how this is handled
in other grievance proceedings at the University. Ms. Cole suggested that Regent
Nielsen's concerns might be better addressed in the guidelines.
Regent McFee then withdrew from her motion the provision that language
be added allowing a representative to participate in the proceedings and appear
in the absence or inability of the accused to attend. But she requested that that
matter be addressed in the guidelines and addressed when the policy is brought
back to review. In response to a question from President Duderstadt, Regent
McFee clarified that the intent of her motion was that the policy not be labeled
"interim", but that it have a sunset of six months.
Regent Baker seconded the motion.
Regent Varner stated her agreement that a policy needs to be put in place.
Regarding Regent Baker's concerns about due process, she noted that there is a
body of case law supporting the procedures laid out in the policy. She concurred
that it was important for the University community to know that the Regents consider sexual harassment to be a very serious problem that must be addressed.
Regent Varner suggested that the Office of the General Counsel, rather than the
Office of Affirmative Action, be charged with monitoring the policy. She also
stated that because implementation of the policy is an administrative responsibility, she did not think it was necessary for the guidelines to be approved by the
Regents. Regent Varner expressed that the Board should adopt the policy as a
permanent policy, not an interim policy.
President Duderstadt suggested that Regent McFee's motion might be
amended to state that the policy be adopted with the proviso that it be brought
back to the Board for review in six months. This would replace the six-month termination "sunset" clause.
Regent Varner offered an amendment that the policy be adopted and returned to the board in six months, without a sunset provision. Regent Waters
seconded the motion.


-153 -



October Meeting, 1991


Provost Whitaker observed that the policy had been written because there
has been considerable concern among women faculty and staff that a permanent
policy be put in place; that the officers are concerned that a policy exist that reduces the University's legal liability for not having such a policy, and that these
matters be handled in the informal settlement method as much as possible.
Noting that individuals are always free to go to court, he reiterated that the goals
are to keep the matters from escalating to formal legal proceedings, and to stop
the offensive behavior.
Regent Nielsen stated that he had suggested the six-month sunset clause to
give the Regents an opportunity to thoroughly review all aspects of the policy, because they hadn't yet had sufficient time to do so.
Regent Baker spoke in support of Regent Nielsen and against Regent
Varners amendment, and noted that he had substantial objections to the policy,
as he had previously stated. He stated that a sunset clause would give the administration an incentive to address the issues that had been raised by the Regents.
Regent Baker also observed that in light of the hearings for the nomination of
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, he expected that federal legislation
would soon be developed that would address these issues, and that this legislation
would include the concept of innocent until proven guilty. Regent Baker also reiterated that student conduct should be included in the sexual harassment policy.
Provost Whitaker pointed out that student-to-student sexual harassment does
not involve the power relationships that are addressed in this policy, and that the
women employees on campus are very concerned about having a comfortable
working environment.
Regent Power spoke in favor of the amendment and in favor of adopting the
policy not as an interim policy. He also noted that sexual harassment is a separate issue from political correctness; sexual harassment has to do with what happens when people in authority relationships over others misuse that authority.
He noted that this policy has been a matter of discussion among faculty for a
number of years, and that the document had undergone considerable review by
the Board and others that had greatly improved it.
Regent Smith suggested that after the policy is revised, experts at the Law
School review it. Counsel Cole responded that leading experts at the Law School
had been consulted during the drafting of this policy, and that their expertise
would continue to be utilized. She also pointed out that she herself had a national reputation in this area, and she was confident that the policy was appropriate.
Regent Baker asked why it was necessary for the language to make any reference to the Interim Policy on Discrimination and Discriminatory Conduct by Students. Ms. Cole and Provost Whitaker responded that the sentence is there to
point out in what areas the policy does not apply.
Regent Brown called the question on Regent Varner's amendment that the
policy be adopted and be brought back to the board for review in six months.
The intent is that in six months the administration would submit a report on implementation of the policy. At the suggestion of Regent Nielsen, the six-month


-154 -



October Meeting, 1991


time period was changed to one year in Regent Varner's amendment. The vote
was then taken on the amendment, and it carried, with Regents Brown, Power,
McFee, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regents Baker, Nielsen, and Smith opposed.
Regent Power then moved to amend Regent McFee's original motion to include the proviso that the Office of the General Counsel, rather than the Office
of Affirmative Action, would be designated to monitor repeated complaints. In
response to a comment by Regent Nielsen about representation at proceedings
for people who could not be present, Provost Whitaker stated he would be willing
to include language addressing that issue in the final version of the policy.
Regent McFee agreed to accept Regent Power's amendment that the statistics would be developed generically by the Office of Affirmative Action, but that
the Office of the General Counsel would monitor repeated complaints.
The vote was then taken on Regent McFee's amended motion; it was approved unanimously.
There being no further discussion, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting is scheduled for November 14 and 15, 199 1. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses for the month of September 1991 totalled $316.33.

He was appointed an instructor in psychology in the Department of Pediatrics in 1956; he was promoted to assistant professor in 1963, associate professor in 1966, and professor in 1970. He established and became the


-166 -



November Meeting, 1991


head of the Pediatric Psychology Unit in 1965; under his direction, pediatric psychology services began to have a major impact on patient care.
Professor Gibson was one of the early pioneers in the expansion of the child
psychologist's role in pediatrics to include assessment of and intervention for the
effects of illness on the child's psychosocial and developmental status. His clinical and research interests include the effects of trauma in early infancy on later
personality development; he also became a nationally known authority on developmental issues in blind infants through his work with Selma Fraiberg. Large
numbers of clinical psychology interns have benefited from his vast experience
and clinical expertise.
A life fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric Association, Professor Gibson
has also been a member of numerous other professional societies, including the
American Psychology Association, the Michigan Psychological Association, and
the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His administrative
service includes positions as director of counseling services at the Medical School
from 1972-83 and assistant dean for student affairs from 1976-83. He served on
the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics from 1968-74 and again from
1984-87, and has been faculty advisor for the Comprehensive Studies and Opportunity Program since 1984. Hs      d is continued empasis on the pursuit of academic
excellence and demonstrated concern for minority students, their health and welfare recently culminated in the Medical School's establishment of the Ralph M.
Gibson Award which is presented annually to the senior minority medical student
who has best demonstrated these qualities througout his or her medical career.
Professor Gibson received the Wade McCree Distinguished Faculty Award in
1987, and in 1988 was included in an exhibit of the accomplishments of the most
distinguished Ph.D. recipients of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate
Studies over the past fifty years. In 1987, Professor Gibson was also honored by
his appointment to the National Advisory Child Health and Human Development Council ofr                                        the National nstitutes of Health. His role  ciensures that children from all backgrounds will benefit from the care and concern
for their well-being that have characterized Professor Gibson's long and tireless
efforts throughout his career.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Ralph
M. Gibson Professor Emeritus of Psychology in Pediatrics and Communicable
Diseases.
Donald A. Jones, associate professor of mathematics, will retire from active
faculty status on December 31, 1991, after a distinguished teaching and research
career.
Professor Jones was born in Topeka, Kansas. He received his B.S. degree in
mathematics from Iowa State College in 1952 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
from the State University of Iowa in 1956 and 1959, respectively. He joined the
mathematics department at the University of Michigan as assistant professor in
1959 and was promoted to associate professor in 1965.
For many years, Professor Jones headed our excellent undergraduate actuarial science program, many of whose graduates are among the leaders of the insurance industry. Professor Jones provided these students with a unique college
learning environment and also made major contributions to actuarial education
nationally. His book, Actuarial Mathematics, co-authored with N. Bowers, H.
Gerber, J. Hickman, and C. Nesbitt, is the basic text for the Actuarial Society
exams.

November Meeting, 1991


Professor Jones was an early participant in and supporter of the annual actuarial research conferences which have been held for the past 26 years. He introduced concepts and applications of Bayesian statistics to the actuarial profession
in North America, and he was a proponent of applying statistical theory in research collaborations with Professors A Mayerson,. Bowers, and H. Gerber.
Professor Jones co-authored papers with Professor Gerber on credibility theory,
dividends for group  surance, and stop-loss insurr ance prend s. Hure remains as
a consultant for the Society of Actuaries examination on risk theory
The Regents now salute this actuarial educator and scientist for his contributions by naming Donald A. Jones Associate Professor Emeritus of Mathematics.
Harold L. Stahly, professor of education at the University of Michigan-Flint,
retired from active faculty status on May 31, 1991, after a most productive career
as a teacher, advisor, and scholar.
Professor Stahly received his BA degree rom Greensville College in 1949,
his M.S. degree from Butler University in 1954, and his Ed.D. degree from Indiana University in 1961. He came to the University of Michigan-Flint in 1965 as
associate professor of education and was promoted to professor in 1971.
Professor Stahly has distinguished himself as a teacher, advisor, and leader at
the UM-Flint, with an outstanding record of service to the University and the
community. One of the foremost experts in the state on the history and development of teaching credential requirements, Professor Stahy was for many years
UM-Flint's director of teacher education, in charge of all student teaching and
certification for the campus. He has served with distinction on every major
years ago, he initiated the  r  School Project, a cooperative school that has
continued to this day. Professor Stahly is to be commended for his twenty-six
years of commitment to the University of Michigan-Flint and the educational
community.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Harold L. Stahly Pro essor Emeritus of Education.
Henry H. Swain, M.D., professor of pharmacology, retired from active faculty
status on October 31, 1991, after a distinguished and productive career as a
scholar, educator, and administrator.
Born in Champaign, Illinois, Dr. Swain received his BA degree from the
University of Illinois in 1943. During World War I, he served as a commissioned
officer in the Army Signal Intelligence Service, with overseas assignments in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan. In 1947, Dr. Swain enrolled in medical school
at the University of Illinois, where he pursued a career in academic pharmacology and received his M.S. and M.D. degrees in 1951. After completing an internship at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago, Dr. Swain began his academic
career as an instructor in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of
Cincinnati in 1952. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1954 as an instructor in pharmacology; he was promoted to assistant professor in 1957, associate professor in 1962, and professor in 1967.
After pursuing earlier research on cardiac electrophysiology, Dr. Swain later
assumed administrative responsibility for a colony of narcotic-addicted monkeys
that had been established to measure the physical dependence liability of narcotic analgesic agents. He also worked for ten years with faculty colleagues in
the Department of Computer and Communication Sciences, where he guided the
research activities of graduate students who used computers to simulate biological systems. Three pharmacologists and five computer scientists have received


-168 -



November Meeting 1991


Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan with Dr. Swain as their thesis
chair. Highly regarded as a teacher and mentor, Dr. Swain has been involved in
the education of not only graduate students and medical students, but also of
dental, pharmacy, and nursing students. He has received several teaching
awards, including the Elizabeth C. Crosby Award, the Senior Award, the Galens
Shovel Award, and the Dental Student Teaching Award.
In the Medical School, Dr. Swain served as acting chair of the Department of
Pharmacology on two separate occasions, from 1971-74, and from 1980-81. He
was named assistant dean for faculty affairs in 1982, and ably served in that capacity until 1990. He also served on the Medical School's Executive Committee
and on the Advisory Committee on Appointments, Promotions, and Tenure. Dr.
Swain has been a member of the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics since 1957, and has served as historian of the society since
1970. He also has been a field editor for the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, and has served on the editorial boards for several other scientific journals. In addition, Dr. Swain chaired the Institutional Review Board
for the Parke-Davis Community Research Clinic in Ann Arbor and has served as
president of the American Heart Association of Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated
service by naming Henry H. Swain Professor Emeritus of Pharmacology.
Memorials
No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents
unanimously approved final degree lists for the May 1991 Law School commencement and the August 1991 commencements for schools, colleges, divisions,
and branch campuses. They also approved the tentative doctoral degree list for
the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies commencement of December 1991 and changes to previously approved degree lists.
Henry Russel Lecturer
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents
unanimously approved the appointment of Robert Axelrod, the Arthur W.
Bromage Distinguished University Professor of Political Science and Public
Policy, as the Henry Russel Lecturer for 1992.
University of Michigan 1991 Financial Report Supplemental Schedules for the
Year Ended June 30, 1991
The Regents received the University of Michigan 1991 Financial Report Supplemental Schedules for the Year Ended June 30, 1991. Vice President Womack
responded to questions from the Regents about the report.
Six-Month Report on University Audits
Vice President Womack submitted the Six-Month Report on University
Audits. Mr. Carl Smith, director of university audits, responded to comments
from the Regents about various aspects of the report.

November Meeting, 1991


Refinancing of $56,000,000 Hospital Revenue Bonds, Series 1986B
The Regents received information regarding the refinancing of the outstanding $56,000,000 Hospital Revenue Bonds, Series 1986B variable rate issue.
Financing for Medical Service Plan Revenue Bonds, Series 1991
The Regents were informed of the status of the proposed sale of Medical
Service Plan Revenue Bonds, Series 1991.
University Mortgage Loan Program
Vice President Womack submitted a recommendation to modify the University's mortgage loan program to offer the following two options:
Option 1: Loan-to-value ratio of up to 80 percent; Interest rate competitive
with local lending institutions for similar loans
Option 2: Loan-to-value ratio from 81 percent to 90 percent; Interest rate
will be 1/2 percent higher than the rate offered for Option 1
Regent Baker expressed concern about the risk that would be posed by Option 2 of the proposal. Vice President Womack responded that his staff did not
believe that either proposal created undue risk, and that these options were considered to be beneficial for attracting faculty and staff. Regent Baker suggested
that a maximum purchase value be placed on the University's exposure in Option
2. Vice President Womack responded that this idea had been considered by his
staff, but rejected because it would be adverse to the University's interests. This
is because of their judgement that lower priced properties have more risk of declining below the appraised value than do higher priced properties.
Regent Baker moved that option one e approved as recommended, and that
Option 2 be limited to a cap of $160,000, with review of this limit after one year.
Regent Power pointed out that the risk or the applicant's ability to repay the
debt, is evaluated at thee time that the mortgage application is made. Vice President Womack reiterated his previous explanation that the risk is reduced by not
having a cap.
President Duderstadt observed that there are two issues: the financial risk to
the University and the recognition that the 1990s will be a critical time for recruiting faculty. He noted that the University will be competing with other institutions that have more aggressive home financing programs, and cautioned the
Regents not to lose sight of the University's human resource interest in considering this action.
In response to other questions, Vice President Womack pointed out that the
University offers competitive rates, but that the advantage to faculty and staff is
that the University does not charge points for its mortgage loans. Mr. Norman
Herbert, University investment officer, pointed out that there had only been one
default, out of about 80 to 100 mortgages per year, in 25 years of the program.


-170 -



November Meeting, 1991


Following further discussion, Regents Power and Varner stated that they did
not believe that a cap was necessary. Regent Smith seconded Regent Baker's
motion. Regent Baker reiterated that his motion limited the cap to a one-year
time period. The vote was then taken on Regent Baker's motion. It failed, with
Regents Baker and Smith in favor, and Regents Brown, Nielsen, Power, McFee,
Varner, and Waters opposed.
Regent Power moved approval of options one and two, as recommended in
the action request (and stated above). Regent Baker observed that Option 2
goes beyond the boundaries of prudent lending, and he would vote against it.
Regent Waters seconded RegentPower's motion, and it was approved, with Reents Brown, Nielsen, Power, McFee, Vaner, and Waters in favor and Regents
Baker and Smith opposed.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the following projects: School of Dentistry chiller replacement; Kresge Medical Research III Building fourth floor renovation; Medical Science II Building chiller replacement; and construction of a gas storage facility at the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Solid State Electronics
Laboratory.
University of Michigan Medical Center North Entrance Parking Structure
This item was returned for reconsideration, having been tabled the previous
month. Vice President Womack called on Mr. Fred Mayer and Mr. Douglas
Hannah, of the University Planner's Office, to present the project. With the aid
of maps, photographs, and an architectural model, Mr. Hannah described the
project, including the criteria that had been used in determining the location and
how it fits in with the Medical Center master plan.
Following some discussion, Regent Nielsen moved approval of the project,
the site, submission of a Certificate of Need application, authorization for appointing TMP Associates, Inc., and Hansen Lind Meyer, Inc., as architect, and
imtiation of the design process. Regent Baker seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
Proposed Contract Between the University of Michigan and Imagine, Inc.
Regent Brown moved, Regent Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved a contract between the University of Michigan and Imagine,
Inc. Because the owners and employees of Imagine, Inc., (David Gregory, Henry
Flurry, and Harold Brokaw), are also University of Michigan employees, this contract falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement will be Imagine, Inc., and the Regents of
the University of Michigan. Kenneth Slayton will sign the contract
as chief executive officer of Imagine, Inc.


-171 -



November Meeting, 1991


2.  The proposed contract is a joint study agreement. There are no restrictions on publication or openness of the research. Imagine and
the University would each pay one half of Henry Flurry's and
Harold Brokaw's salaries ($30,139 each). The University will be
responsible for fringe benefits (approximately $6,819). David Gregory will provide consultation to the project, from time to time, as
part of normal research activities as director of the Center for Performing Arts and Technology (CPAT). CPAT facilities will be
used by Harold Brokaw and Henry Flurry to do the software development. No portion of David Gregory's University salary will be
paid by Imagine.
The University will retain ownership of the developed software.
Imagine will receive an exclusive license to commercially market
the software. Imagine will pay a royalty to the University based on
the sales of the software under terms to be negotiated with the Intellectual Properties Office.
3.  Imagine, Inc., is owned in part by David Gregory (27 percent),
Henry Flurry (17 percent), and Harold Brokaw (17 percent).
Imagine, Inc., is expected to profit from commercialization of the
licensed software.
Appointments to Medical Staff Membership
On the recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive
Board, Regent Power moved, Regent Smith seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, several appointments to medical staff membership.
Honorary Degrees
Regent Smith moved, Regent Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously
approved, a recommendation for an honorary degree.
Law School Involvement in Policy-Making
Regent Brown observed that at the last meeting comments were made alleging that the Law School had expressed approval of the student code ("Policy on
Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment by Students in a University Environment") that had later been declared unconstitutional. Regent Brown noted
that Dean Bollinger had responded to these comments in a letter mailed to the
Regents. Regent Brown noted that
"It should be stated that the Law School did not draft the code. Some
members of the faculty were consulted in a general way about it, and made
some suggestions. But it should be understood by everyone that this Board
and the administration do not in any way understand that the code was
drafted by the Law School or the Law School faculty or any members
thereof. Nor was it approved by the Law School faculty in any way. As a
matter of fact, some specific objections and concerns were raised by some


-172 -



November Meeting, 1991


members of the faculty that were consulted. The public should not be confused that the code was ever approved by the Law School or the faculty in
any way."
There followed a discussion about the propriety of consulting with Law
School faculty on matters that come before the Board on which they might have
some expertise. Regent Baker suggested that if such advice is sought in the
future, it be done via a formal request and a formal written opinion. Regent
Nielsen concurred that if a statement is made that the Law Schoof has reviewed a
matter, there ought to be a letter from the school confirming that.
Regent McFee observed that there would be a potential conflict of interest in
seeking legal counsel from Law School faculty. However, Regent Nielsen stated
that in the case where certain faculty are experts in a topic, they have a public
service obligation to review it. President Duderstadt commented that he thought
that asking a faculty member to provide professional expertise about a University
function that would affect the faculty member directly would constitute a potential conflict of interest.
Regent Power noted that there is a difference between seeking informal advice while a policy is being developed and rendering a professional opinion on
something. He agreed that if a professional opinion is being sought, professionals in the field outside of the University ought to be consulted. He also observed
that it was unwise to interpose the Law School as a source of authority into discussions that come before the Board.
There followed a ten-minute recess.
The meeting reconvened at 2:45 PM.
SACUA Presentation
President Duderstadt introduced James Diana, associate professor of natural
resources and chair of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs
(SACUA). Professor Diana stated that he would present an overview of faculty
governance and the role of the faculty in the mission of the University. He would
also focus on current issues of concern to faculty.
Professor Diana noted that the faculty carry out the University's primary mission: teaching, research, and service. Because the faculty are the only University
personnel who regularly deal with the broad spectrum of the University's mission,
the faculty should play a significant role in setting and understanding policy. He
then described the typical scenario of how and why a person becomes a faculty
member. He noted that as the economic climate for the faculty worsens, they are
becoming more concerned with such issues as pensions, retirement benefits, and
health insurance.
Another concern is the changing role of the faculty in the University. There
has been an increase in activities designed to address questions of social norms
for the University, such as the sexual harassment policy. Although faculty believe
such a policy is necessary, there is concern about how faculty will be treated in


-173 -



November Meeting, 1991


the event that complaints are made, and whether they will be given due process.
Faculty are also troubled about the climate of political correctness that intimidates faculty and students from discussing some issues.
Professor Diana observed that as the perceived importance of research with
respect to tenure and promotion is inflated, teaching becomes de-emphasized.
Thus, the incentives for good teaching are much less than the incentives for good
research. Faculty believe that this concern, encompassing the role of the University of Michigan m the 21st century, needs more debate and discussion.
Professor Diana then described the faculty governance structure and explained the issues currently before it. These include the replacement of faculty
committees by short-term task forces, the increased role of professional administrators at the eense of faculty and students, and the perception that the Regents make formal policy with little input from faculty an students.
In response to comments from the Regents, Professor Diana acknowledged
that the Senate Assembly had approved the sexual harassment policy before it
was brought to the Regents. Regent Brown pointed out that students do have
direct input into decision-making through public comments, direct contacts with
Regents and administrators, and committee service. Professor Diana responded
that both faculty and students should be involved at the level of final discussion
of policy issues.
CESF Report
Following further discussion about the issues raised by Professor Diana, President Duderstadt called on Frederick Beutler, professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science, to present the report of the Committee on the
Economic Status of the Faculty.
Professor Beutler discussed the function of CESF, and described the open
issues that CESF is actively pursumg. These include retirement after age 70; the
long term disability plan; utilization of the long term care benefit; administrative
growth (increase in the proportion of nonfaculty to faculty salaries paid from the
General Fund); and the need for a written policy on defense and indemnification.
Following his presentation, Professor Beutler responded to comments from the
Regents.
Public Comments
The meeting resumed in the Anderson Room of the Michigan Union, where
the Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics indicated: Rodney Myers, student, Barbara A. Vicory, student, and Tracy Ore, student and teaching assistant, in favor of expanding the definition of "family" for
purposes of family housing eligibility; Safiya Khalid, member of N.E.E.D. Service, on denial of access to the Michigan Union; Charlie B. Flowers, citizen, on
how the N.E.E.D. Service has helped his community and family; Barbara Meadows, social worker, on the value of the N.E.E.D. Service; Thomas J. Nash, citizen,
and Bren Quilter, citizen, on their opposition to changing the definition of
"family" for purposes of family housing eligibility; and Demetrius A. Bady, student, on the isolation and problems of minority students.

November Meeting, 1991
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:50 PM. The
next meeting is scheduled for December 19 and 20, 1991. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses for the month of
October 1991 totalled $1,769.99.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1991


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, December 19, 1991
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner, and
Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Kelly, Swain, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones and Wilson. Vice President Johnson and Regent Baker were
absent.
Executive Session Motion
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and recognized Regent
Nielsen, who made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed session on December 19, 1991, at 4:00 P.M., in the Regents' Room, for the purpose of consulting with the Board's attorney regarding trial or settlement strategy in connection
with specific pending litigation.
The motion was approved unanimously.
Annual Report on Research
President Duderstadt then called on Vice President Kelly to present the
annual report on research for 1991.
Vice President Kelly reported that in 1990-91, the University's total research
volume increased by 13.3 percent, to a record total of $324,088,970. Of this total,
64.6 percent came from federal agencies, 22.0 percent came from nonfederal
sources, and 13.4 percent came from University funds. Vice President Kelly displayed a series of charts and graphs illustrating research expenditures by sponsor
and by University unit, as well as trends in indirect cost recovery and indirect
costs as a percent of total research expenditures. He warned that the 26.0 percent cap on research administrative costs to be imposed by the federal Office of
Management and Budget on July 1, 1992, could cost the University as much as
$10 million or more per year in its indirect cost recoveries. The effect of this cap
will be to shift the burden of indirect costs from the federal government to the
universities, and will have a profound effect on the University's capacity to support and maintain its overall research activities at their current levels.
Following his presentation, Vice President Kelly responded to questions and
comments from the Regents. President Duderstadt pointed out that the remarkable level of sponsored research activity is due to the quality, talents, and ability
of the faculty. Regent Brown noted that for every dollar the University receives
from the state, more than one dollar from outside the state is injected into the
state's economy.

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved adoption of the following retirement memoirs:
Edmund H. Creeth, professor of English language and literature, will retire
from active faculty status on December 31, 1991.
A native Californian, Professor Creeth received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D.
degrees from the University of California at Berkeley in 1951, 1953, and 1956, respectively. He taught at Berkeley and at Pomona College prior to coming to the
University of Michigan as an instructor in English in 1958. He was promoted to
assistant professor in 1960, associate professor in 1965, and professor in 1974.
Professor Creeth taught also as a visiting professor at the Oregon College of Education (summer 1959) and the University of Essex, England (fall 1968), and has
lectured, chiefly on English Renaissance topics, at the University of Kentucky,
Chicago's Newberry Library, Charles University in Prague, and at the University's own English Department Colloquium. He has served on numerous committees at the departmental, college, and graduate school levels, including the department's executive committee. Of particular note is his work as a member of


-187 -



December Meeting, 1991


the University Club board of directors (1975-84) and as associate editor of the
Michigan Quarterly Review (1973 to the present).
As a scholar, Professor Creeth has devoted himself both to the Renaissance
and to the Middle Ages. His work on Shakespeare, whose roots he locates in the
medieval past, is distilled in articles, reviews, and an important book of 1976,
Mankynde in Shakespeare. For many years, his monthly column, "Landmarks of
Criticism," appeared in the Shakespeare Newsletter. Students of the Renaissance
are permanently in his debt for his scrupulously edited collections of Tudor Plays
(1966) and Tudor Prose 1513-1570 (1969). A popular teacher of Shakespeare, he
has branched out widely, having offered many times every introductory departmental course, as well as more specialized courses on Milton, Shakepeare's
rivals, and early English masters.
Perhaps what most distinguishes Professor Creeth's career is his long and devoted commitment to creative writing. At least once every year since 1973, he
has taught this extremely difficult subject, supplementing classroom instruction
with some fifty courses in independent study. His own much-praised novel,
Deerlover (1987), is now being turned into a screenplay, and he is currently at
work on a second novel, With a Human Face, telling of the Prague spring of 1968.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
Edmund H. Creeth Professor Emeritus of English Language and Literature.
Norman S. Radin, professor of neurochemistry in the Department of Psychiatry and research scientist in the Mental Health Research Institute, will retire
from active faculty status on December 31, 1991, after a most productive career
as a researcher and teacher.
Born and raised in New York City, Professor Radin took undergraduate and
graduate studies at Columbia University receiving his B.A. degree in 1941 and his
Ph.D. degree in biochemistry in 1949. He did his postdoctoral work with H. S.
Barker at the University of California at Berkeley on enzymes of purine decomposition from 1949-50, and with Esmond Snell at the University of Texas Biochemical Institute in Austin on bacterial amino acid metabolism from 1950-52.
He then joined the faculty of Northwestern University, where he served as an instructor from 1952-55, assistant professor from 1955-57, and associate professor
from 1957-60. From 1954-57, he also worked as a principal scientist at the Veterans Administration Research Hospital in Chicago. It was during these years that
he began his life-long interest in galactolipid metabolism, particularly in relation
to the brain. His studies of the composition of cerebroside components and their
biosynthesis remain classic contributions to the neurochemical literature.
Professor Radin came to the University of Michigan in 1960 as a research
biochemist (now known as research scientist) at the Mental Health Research Institute. In 1973 he was awarded the additional title of professor of biochemistry
with tenure in the Department of Psychiatry. The latter title was changed to professor of neurochemistry in 1984.
For the last thirty years, Professor Radin's laboratory at the University of
Michigan has been a center for research on the glycolipids, and has served as a
major training site for postdoctoral fellows and students. His curriculum vita is
studded with technical notes and inventions related to modification of laboratory
techniques, particularly in relation to the counting of radioisotopes. During the
last five years, Professor Radin has dedicated himself to tumor cell metabolism.
Professor Radin has been in demand as an editor by major journals in his
field, and has served widely on study sections and committees. Among his many


-188 -



December Meeting, 1991


honors are a Javits Investigator Award from the National Institutes of Health and
the University Senior Research Scientist Lectureship for 1990.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Norman S. Radin Professor Emeritus of Neurochemistry and
Research Scientist Emeritus.
Memorials
No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees
Regent Nielsen moved, Regent Brown seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, several recommendations for honorary degrees.
Venture Capital Investment
Vice President Womack introduced Alicia Cooney, a representative of the
University's investment advisor, Cambridge Associates. Ms. Cooney presented a
recommendation that $5 million of the University Endowment Fund be committed to Summit Ventures Iii, LP., in keeping with the Board's authorization that 5
percent of the endowment fund be committed to venture capital investments.
Following some discussion, Regent Power moved that $5 million of the University Endowment Fund be committed to Summit Ventures III, L.P. Regent
Varner seconded the motion, and it was approved, with Regents Brown, McFee,
Nielsen, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor, and Regent Smith abstaining.
Sale of Medical Service Plan Revenue Bonds, Series 1991
Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the Medical Service Plan
Revenue Bonds, Series 1991 had been sold and delivered to Morgan Stanley &
Co. Incorporated and Cain Brothers, Shattuck & Company, Incorporated, according to the terms authorized by the Regents at their meeting of July 19, 1991.
Resolution to Dissolve Closely-Held Company Devised via the Estate of Professor James V. McConnell
Regent Brown moved, Regent Varner seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved the following resolution to dissolve Planarian Press, Inc.:
Whereas, the Regents of the University of Michigan, a Michigan
Constitutional Corporation, was assigned all shares of the capital stock
of Planarian Press, Inc. from the Estate of James V. McConnell, Deceased (Washtenaw Probate File No. 90-93590-IE); and
Whereas, Planarian Press, Inc. has completely discontinued and
closed its business;
Now Therefore, Be It Resolved that the Regents of the University
of Michigan having voting powers hereby consent to a dissolution of
Planarian Press, Inc.

December Meeting, 1991


Improvement in the University's Long Term Disability Plans
Vice President Womack explained that employees at the Medical Center had
requested improvements in the long term disability (LTD) plans. He noted that
all of the Unversity's LTD plans are self-insured; they accumulate and set aside
funds to cover the payments. The costs of the improvements to the plans will be
covered by staff members who have coverage over a salary of $50,000, as described in the Regents communication.
In response to a comment from Regent Power, Vice President Womack clarified that this proposal would be entirely paid for by the participants. Regent
Nielsen pointed out that this type of benefit could be sought in the future by
other employee groups as a Umversity-paid benefit, which could lead to higher
fringe benefi  ts for the University. Vice President Womack acknowledged
that this possibility exists, but is unavoidable if coverage is to be extended.
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved changing the Expanded and Physicians LTD Plans to provide for replacement of 65 percent of salary and purchasing stop-loss coverage,
and that such changes be made effective February 1, 1992, or as soon thereafter
as possible.
Addition of Long Term Care Options
Vice President Womack introduced a request that the Regents approve the
University's offering all of the Long Term Care (LTC) options available from
TIAA, rather than the one plan approved earlier this year, noting that individual
employees pay the entire cost of the plan.
Regent Nielsen questioned whether Regental approval could be worded so
as to only rema in effect as long as this benefit is entirely employee-paid. Vice
President Womack pointed out that it would be difficult to place a condition on a
plan that would remove it as an option from the collective bargaining process.
Regent Power observed that there are two adverse consequences in making
this type of improvement in fringe benefit options: 1) actions taken by the University tend to affect the nature of expectations in the local labor market as to
what benefits will be offered; and 2) by continually improving the mix of fringe
benefits within the University community, expectations are created that fringe
benefits will continue to be improved. This raises the larger question as to where
the University is headed with respect to fringe benefits.
Vice President Womack stated that from a policy perspective, it may not be
wise to prohibit by official action the enhancement of a fringe benefit unless that
benefit is paid solely by the employee. He also doubted that there would be a
way to craft a public policy without increasing expectations that there will be increased enhancements in the future. Regent McFee pointed out that both the
LTD and LTC plans allowed employees to take the responsibility to put portions
of their salaries away for future needs, instead of relying on their employer to
provide that for them.


-190 -



December Meeting, 1991
Regent Nielsen requested that staff be urged to craft language restricting
who the payor can be when constructing future staff benefits options. Vice President Womack responded that he would seek advice of counsel on this matter.
There being no further discussion, Regent Nielsen moved, Regent Power seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, the offering of all Long Term
Care options available from TIAA in the winter of 1992.
Medical Science Research Building III
Vice President Womack informed the Regents that a contract for construction of the Medical Science Research Building III had been awarded to the
lowest bidder, MA Mortenson Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Cancer and Geriatrics Centers Building
Vice President Womack called on Mr. Douglas Hanna, of the University's
Plant Extension Office, to present the design of the Cancer and Geriatrics Centers Building.
Mr. Hanna used site maps, detailed diagrams of each floor, and a threedimensional scale model to illustrate his presentation of the proposed design of
the Cancer and Geriatrics Centers Building.
In    i the discussion that followed, Regent Power noted that there appears to be
an assumption that most at ients will be dropped off in front ofth building,
rather than driving themselves and entering the building from the parking structure. He believes this assumption to be erroneous, and requested that planners
re-evaluate the interchanges between this and other medical center buildings and
the medical center parking structures. Regent Power observed that the design
problems created by entering Hospitals buildings from parking structures have
not been adequately addressed.
Regent Nielsen raised the issue of how the Cancer and Geriatrics Centers
will impact the occupancy rate of the Med Inn. Dr. Zuidema noted that because
the new facility would be an ambulatory facility, it would not be expected to increase the demand for accommodations at the Med n t that this would be
investigated further.
Following further discussion, Regent Nielsen moved, Regent Brown seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, the design of the Cancer and Geriatrics Centers Building as presented, subject to points raised during the discussion.
University of Michigan Hospitals Replacement of Angiography Equipment with
a Neurointerventional Imaging System
Regent Brown moved approval of submission of a Certificate of Need application to the Michigan Department of Public Health for renovating the angiography suite at the University of Michigan Hospitals and replacing it with a Toshiba
neurointerventional imaging system, as described in the Regents communication.


-191 -



December Meeting, 1991


Regent Nielsen seconded the motion, and following some discussion, it was
approved unanimously.
University of Michigan Hospitals Implementation of Physician Order Entry/
Results Reporting Automation in the Medical Center
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved submission of a Certificate of Need application to the
Michigan Department of Public Health for order entry/results reporting software
at the University of Michigan Hospitals, and purchase of the software contingent
on approval of the Certificate of Need.
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved the following projects: 1) Installation of an emission containment facility at the Positron Emission Tomography (P.E.T.) Laboratory in
the Kresge Medical Research Building HI; 2) ventilation improvements in the
Medical Science complex; 3) Parking Operations annual maintenance for 1992;
4) Michigan Stadium concrete restoration (which will result in the addition of 829
additional seats to the stadium); and 5) Renovation of Yost Ice Arena.
Reassignment of University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual Property (Paul B.
Watkins, M.D.)
Regent Smith moved, Regent Power seconded, and all seven Regents present
unanimously approved reassignment of the University's ownership interest in the
intellectual property of Paul B. Watlkins, M.D. ("Erythromycin Breath Test"). Because the inventor of the intellectual property is also a University employee, this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided inn compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the Assignment Agreement Agem   will be the University of
Michigan and Paul B. Watkins, M.D.
2. The terms and pecuniary interests were previously disclosed to and
approved by the Regents on July 16, 1987, and are hereby incorporated by reference in this action request.
Revision of Regents' Bylaws Sections 11.21, 11214, 11216, and 11.217 (Board in
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics)
Vice President Kennedy noted that the Regents had previously approved
changes in the size and composition of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics. Along with these, the Office of the General Counsel was proposing additional changes to the Regents' Bylaws to bring them into accordance with Big
Ten governance, to more accurately reflect how the Board in Control actually operates, and to make the Board in Control bylaws similar to those of other University committees and boards. On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent
Varner, the Regents unanimously approved changes to Regents' Bylaws Sections
11.21, 11.214, 11.216, and 11.217. (Regent Brown pointed out an error in paragraph 3 of Section 11.214 of the Regents communication; the correct language
appears below.)

participation in all forms of physical exercise
Following a five-minute recess, the Regents returned to the table to consider
several items which had not been included with the agenda materials.
Vacant Land, State Street (approximately 34 acres)
Vice President Womack announced that a parcel of vacant land on the west
side of State Street approximately one-quarter mile south of the University golf
course was available or purchase. In response to questions from the Regents, it
was noted that the assessed value of the property is $1 million, and it is located in
Pittsfield Township, rather than within the city of Ann Arbor.
Following some discussion, Regent Nielsen moved, Regent Power seconded,
and the Regents unanimously approved, completing the purchase of this parcel at
a price of $1.35 per square foot. The final purchase price will be based upon the
square footage determined by a survey.
Vacant Land, State Street (approximately 20 acres)
Vice President Womack described this proposed transaction, which includes
purchase of 16 ~ acres of land, acceptance of a gift from the owners of the 20-acre
parcel of the remaining 4 ~ acres, and an exchange and conveyance of lots on Park
Crest, a small road off State Street located immediately to the north of the
20-acre parcel (see map on Regents Communication). The transaction also includes the University's joining in a request to vacate Park Crest. Acquisition of
the land will provide the University with a number of expansion opportunities,
and is supported by the University's planning consultant, Johnson Johnson &
Roy/inc.
In response to a comment from Regent Nielsen, Vice President Womack
stated that counsel would be asked to ensure that the transaction would not violate the Plat Act.


-195 -



December Meeting, 1991
Mr. Norman Herbert responded to a question from Regent Smith about what
would be the result of the University's vacating Park Crest. Regent Smith
pointed out that the owners of the property adjacent to the roadway would have
total control over the use of that roadway for purposes of ingress and egress. Mr.
Herbert noted that the University would have an iterest in participating in these
decisions to the extent that they would impact the University-owned lots. He further stated that the University is vacating the road because it does not have a
need for it as a form of ingress and egress to University land. Regent Brown clarified the legal implications of vacating a roadway, noting that if a road is vacated,
it does not exist. In response to a question from Regent Smith as to whether the
new landowners could construct a building on that road, Regent Brown and Mr.
Herbert responded that they could. Regent Smith pointed outhat this would effectively cut off access to University property via this road, and she would not
support this action.
Regent Nielsen moved approval ofth the transaction of the University's acquiring through gift, purchase, and exchange, the 20~ acre State Street parcel and Lot
4 on Park Crest at a total cost of $1275,000, and the University's conveying Lots
36, 37, and 38 to Nick Michos and Sam Roumanis, as described in the Regents
communication, subject to its not violating the Plat Act. Regent McFee seconded
the motion, and it was adopted, with Regents Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power,
Varner, and Waters in favor and Regent Smith opposed.
11 t Acre Parcel, Northwest Corner of Hubbard Drive and Huron Parkway
Vice President Womack reported that in order to expand its facility at the
corner of Plymouth Road and Huron Parkway, Warner Lambert/Parke Davis has
offered to purchase for $3 million an 11 acre parcel of University-owned land located at the northwest corner of Hubbard Drive and Huron Parkway, which is adjacent to the south of its property.
Vice President Womack noted that Johnson Johnson & Roy, Inc. (JJR) was
in support of the sale. He read the following comments from JJR into the record,
noting that the University would seek to include these points in the agreement
that is ultimately reached with Warner Lambert/Parke Davis:
1) A generous setback needs to be maintained along the north side of
Hubbard Road so that the potential non-University development does
not conflict with the University image.
2) Adequate screen berms and plantings should be used to screen the north
side of Hubbard Road so that primary emphasis is placed on the University of Michigan North Campus.
3) We further recommend that Hubbard Road west of Huron Parkway provides exclusive access to University facilities. It is desirable therefore
that vehicular access to the 11-acre parcel be achieved solely off of
Plymouth Road via the internal loop road and/or Huron Parkway.
4) Because the development of the proposed site would have an impact on
the campus, we recommend that the University should have an opportunity to review Warner Lambert development plans.

December Meeting, 1991


President Duderstadt reported that although Regent Baker could not be
present at the meeting, he had raised several issues about the importance of this
site and its location adjacent to the entrance to North Campus. He said that he
believed Vice President Womack, through discussions with JJR and Warner
Lambert, had successfully addressed Regent Baker's concerns.
Regent Varner moved approval of the sale of the parcel on the northwest
corner of Hubbard Drive and Huron Parkway to Warner Lambert/Parke Davis
at a price of $3.0 million, subject to an appraisal of the value of the parcel.
Regent Waters seconded the motion.
Regent Smith expressed several concerns with the sale of this property. She
noted that the land cannot be replaced, and is a gateway to the University.
Therefore, it was important that the University maintain control over the type of
architecture that is constructed on this site. She then moved to amend the motion so as to place restrictions in the deed giving the University the right to
review and approve architectural designs, setbacks, etc. as enumerated in the
letter from JJR. There being no second to the amendment, the vote was taken
on the original motion, and it was approved, with Regents Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Varner, and Waters in favor and Regent Smith opposed.
Sports Betting Resolution
President Duderstadt noted that the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics had recently approved a resolution in support of the limitation of sports
betting, as proposed m 'The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act" being considered by the United States Congress.
Regent McFee spoke in favor of the resolution, and President Duderstadt
noted that the Big Ten presidents had also agreed that it addressed an important
issue. Following further discussion, Regent McFee moved, Regent Smith seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, the following resolution:
RESOLUTION
Whereas, more and more states are looking to various forms of legalized gambling, including sports betting, as a revenue source, and
Whereas, sports betting threatens the integrity of, and public confidence in professional team sports, converting them from wholesome
athletic entertainment into a vehicle for gambling, and
Whereas, most law enforcement officials agree that legalization of
sports betting does not reduce illegal gambling and in fact, by breeding
a new class of bettors, actually facilitates illegal sports gambling operations, and
Whereas, state-sponsored betting on professional sports will "open
the door" to betting on amateur sports such as intercollegiate athletics,
and


-197 -



December Meeting, 1991


Whereas, sports gambling is especially harmful to our youth because of the high levels of interest and devotion that children maintain
towards their favorite teams and players, and
Whereas, teenagers are particularly susceptible to the lure of sports
betting, and
Whereas, of the estimated eight million compulsive gamblers in
America, one million are teenagers, and
Whereas, sports in the United States should not be about winning
or losing money, but about teamwork, discipline, and skilled compettion, and
Whereas, sports betting is inherently an interstate problem requiring a federal solution, and
Whereas, federal legislation entitled 'The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (S.474 and H.R. 74), has been introduced to
preclude additional states from instituting lotteries or other gambling
on the outcome of sports events, and
Whereas, this legislation is supported by such diverse organizations
as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, the International Association
of Chiefs of Police, the Women's Sports Foundation, the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, the National Association of
Professional Baseball Leagues, Pop Warner Football, the American Association of School Administrators, the National Federation of State
High School Associations, the U.S. Baseball Federation, and the National Association of Secondary School Principals,
Now Therefore Be It Resolved that the University of Michigan
Board of Regents supports the limitation of sports betting through the
passage of The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act" (S.474
and H.R. 74) now being considered by the United States Congress.
Resolution in Honor of Henry Johnson
Regent Brown then offered the following resolution, which was adopted by
acclamation:
RESOLUTION
The Regents of the University of Michigan wish to extend their gratitude and best wishes to Vice President Henry Johnson as he begins yet another phase of his service to the University as a senior consultant with the
Alumni Association.
Henry Johnson came to the University of Michigan in 1970 as associate director of the Program for Educational Opportunity in the School of
Education, after having pursued his professional interests as a psychiatric

December Meeting, 1991


social worker for ten years in Indiana, Kansas, and Michigan. He was
appointed vice president for student services in 1972 In this position, he
developed his unique management style, characterized by an unusual
compassion and understanding for the students who were the primary
beneficiaries of his services. It was through this work also that he became a
member and voting delegate of the National Association of Student
Personnel Administrators and a commissioner-at-large for the North
Central Association of Colleges and Schools.
His arrival at the University also marked the start of Henry's extensive
involvement in civic, charitable, and human service organizations. These
commitments reflect his broad interests and strong convictions and provide
a model that few can equal Henry has served as an elected member of the
Ann Arbor Public School Board, and as a board member of the Michigan
Evaluation Resource Center, City of Ann Arbor Compensation
Commission, Child and Family Service of Washtenaw County, Ann Arbor
Symphony, and Kerrytown Concert House. He has also served on the
steering committee of the State of Michigan Leadership 2000 Committee,
and is a member of the Ann ArborArea 2000 Committee. Currently chairof Washtenaw County United Way, over the years he has served in numerous other leadership capacities on the University of Michigan, Washtenaw
County, and Michigan United Way organizations.
This dedication to the broader community made Henry Johnson the
logical choice for the newly created position of vice president for community affairs, to which he was appointed in 1990. In this position, as in all of
his other endeavors, Henry Johnson has demonstrated an enthusiasm, a
graciousness, and an energy that have enabled those associated with him to
aspire to and achieve high levels of accomplishment. Through the years, he
has developed untold numbers of friends and admirers, both within and
outside of the University community.
The Regents therefore extend their warm greetings and deep appreciation to Henry Johnson as he embarks on his new position with the Alumni
Association.
Resolution in Honor of Mary Ann Swain
Regent Power offered the following resolution in honor of Mary Ann Swain,
which was adopted by acclamation:
RESOLUTION
The Regents of the University of Michigan gratefully acknowledge the
extraordinary contributions of Mary Ann Swain, and in particular express
their appreciation for her service as interim vice president for student services.
When she was called upon early in 1990 to assume the leadership of
the 20 units that comprise student services, while retaining her position as
associate vice president for academic affairs, Vice President Swain willingly


-199 -



December Meeting, 1991


accepted the challenge. In her 22 months as interim vice president, she
played a critical role in the evaluation and reorganization of the student
services area while also serving on the search committee that developed the
job description and screened candidates for the permanent vice president
position. All the while, she oversaw important new initiatives and built and
maintained the confidence of the student services team. Now that her
permanent successor has been identifed, Vice President Swain will have
the uxury of being able to turn her full attention to her broad-ranging work
in academic affairs.
In expressing their gratitude to Vice President Swain, the Regents echo
the comments made by President Duderstadt earlier this year, as the search
for herpermanent replacement got underway: "The University owes a great
debt of thanks to Dr. Swain, who voluntarily took on additional responsibilities as interim vicepresidentforstudent services. Ipersonally appreciate
deeply Mary Ann's volunteering to fill two jobs during this period She has
set an example of devotion to the University that all of us admire."
Resolution in Honor of 1991 Michigan Wolverines Football Team
Regent Waters offered the following resolution, which was adopted by acclamation:
RESOLUTION
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend the 1991 Michigan Wolverine football team, its coach, Gary Moeller, and HeismanTrophy-winning wide receiver Desmond Howard for providing Michigan
fans across the nation with an especially thrilling football season.
From his spectacular 93-yard idckoff return against Boston College in
the first game of the season, to his trademark diving catch in the back of
the end zone against Notre Dame in the second, to his 93-yard punt return
in the final game against Ohio State, Desmond Howard, with the help of
his teammates, thrilled the nation with his magical athletic prowess.
Through it all Desmond and his teammates never lost sight of the fundamental tenet of the Michigan football tradition: the importance of the
team over the individual player. As Desmond himself put it upon becoming the second Michigan player in history to win the Heisman Trophy, "7
never put pressure on myself to win this award or any award; I just wanted
to play consistently week in and week out and help our team win."
In demonstrating a grace and maturity beyond his years both on and
off thefield, Desmond Howard is a credit to the University of Michigan and
an inspiration to young athletes across the nation. As the
Big-Ten-champion Wolverines head to Pasadena to compete in the Rose
Bowl for the fifteenth time, the Regents echo Desmond's sentiments in dedicating the Heisman Trophy to the 1991 Michigan football team with a
hearty "Hail to the victors, and Go Blue!"

JANUARY MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, January 16, 1992
The Regents met at 2:30 P.M. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, and
Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Kelly, Swain, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones and Wilson. Regent Varner was absent.
Minutes
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order. Regent Waters moved approval of the minutes of the meeting of December, 1991; Regent Smith seconded
the motion.
Real estate transactions. Referring to the real estate transaction involving
property on State Street that had been approved the previous month, Regent
Baker observed that he had been absent from the January meeting, but he was
dismayed by the giving away of assets, in particular the access to the golf course
property on State Street, since from a construction point of view, that was one of
the best access points on State Street for that property.
Regent Baker also stated that he was saddened by the sale of the 11 acres of
University land on North Campus to Warner Lambert. He noted that that
property had been designated in the North Campus Master Plan for playing fields
on North Campus, and was to have been kept m perpetuity as an entry point to
North Campus. He said that the University had owned all four corers of the
property until the sale of that land, and when driving from North Campus toward
Hubbard Street, one could clearly see the importance of those four corers as an
entry point to the University. Regent Baker said he thinks it was a mistake to sell
that property, and that future generations would look back and wonder why a
piece of property that was so valuable to the integrity of the North Campus was
ever sold. He observed that a good price was received for the parcel, but expressed the hope that it doesn't come to the point where the University campus is
for sale.
Regent Baker noted that the minutes stated that Johnson Johnson & Roy/inc
had given an opinion on the sale. He stated he had not read the report, but that
Johnson Johnson & Roy/inc have an obligation to defend the integrity of their
own plan, and they did not do that. He concluded by saying that he was sorry the
transaction took place.
The vote was then taken, and the minutes of the meeting of December 19,
1991, were approved unanimously as corrected in the additional agenda.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports of Investment Transactions, Plant
Extension, Litigation, Personnel-Labor Relations, and a Report on Non-Competitive Purchases over $2,000 from October 1 through December 31, 1991.

Retirement Memoirs
The Regents voted unanimously to adopt the following Retirement Memoirs:
George R. DeMuth, M.D., professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases in the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on December 31,
1991, concluding a career which has spanned more than three decades.
Raised in Sherwood, Ohio, Dr. DeMuth received his B.S. degree from
Oberlin College in 1946 and his M.D. degree from the Medical College of the
University of Cincinnati in 1950. He served his internship at the University of
Michigan Hospitals from 1950-51 and his pediatric residency at Children's Hospital, University of Cincinnati, from 1951-53, including a year as pediatric chief resident. This was followed by a fellowship in pediatric pathology, also at Children's
Hospital of Cincinnati. After service in the U.S. Army, Dr. DeMuth returned to
the University of Michigan as a research fellow in the Department of Pediatrics
in 1956, developing his special interest in pediatric pulmonary physiology and respiratory diseases of children. Except for a traineeship at the University of Calitornia Cardiovascular Research Institute in 1959, he remained at the University
of Michigan.
In 1958, Dr. DeMuth was appointed assistant professor of pediatrics; he was
promoted to associate professor in 1963 and to professor in 1967. He established
the Pulmonary Function Laboratory at the Medical Center and conducted a study
on the growth and development of lung function in children which is still considered a major contribution. His accomplishments as scholar were recognized by
his election to membership in the Society for Pediatric Research.
Dr. DeMuth's clinical and administrative service to the University of Michigan Medical Center has been truly remarkable. In 1968, he assumed the duties
of associate dean for academic affairs in the Medical School. He developed and
served as the first director of the Integrated Premedical/Medical Program,
known as "Inteflex," which allowed the enrollment of promising high school graduates into the undergraduate school with assurance of admission into the Medical
School. He then directed his gift for developing innovative programs toward the
need for future medical school faculty trained in both the sciences and clinical
medicine. He founded, and still directs, the Medical Scientist Training Program

where students pursue simultaneously Ph.D. and M.D. degrees. These programs
flourish and are lasting contributions in the best Michigan tradition.
The Regents now salute this distinguished and productive clinician, scholar,
and educator by naming George R. DeMuth Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics
and Communicable Diseases.
Richard D. Mann, professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on November 4, 1991.
Professor Mann received his AB. degree in psychology from Harvard College in 1954 and his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in
1956 and 1958, respectively. From 1959-64, he served as an assistant professor at
Harvard College, returning to Michigan in 1964 as an associate professor. He
was promoted to professor of psychology in 1969.
Professor Mann had a special commitment to undergraduate education, especially in the area of creating experential learning opportunities. In his roles as
undergraduate chair, director of the Outreach Program and coordinator of "Introduction to Psychology as a Social Science," he had a great impact on the undergraduate experience within the psychology department. He also performed
exemplary service to the college as a member of the executive committee of the
Program on Studies in Religion, and taught courses in community studies and at
the Residential College. He was a beloved teacher who touched the lives of students not only in psychology but also across the college.
Professor Mann's long-standing interests and research were in the area of
interpersonal interaction and learning. From his early book, Interpersonal Styles
and Group Development (1968), through his later research on the nature of the
contributions of confer-like technology to learning processes, student interaction,
and teaching effectiveness, he has explored the undergraduate learning experience. More recently his work has centered on transpersonal psychology and the
integration of psychology and religion.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and scholar for his dedicated service by naming Richard D. Mann Professor Emeritus of Psychology.
Phyllis M. Ocker, associate director of women's athletics and assistant professor of sports management and communication in the Division of Kinesiology,
retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1991, after a most productive
career of 30 years at the University of Michigan.
After receiving her B.A. degree from tie University of Washington in Seattle in 1948, Professor Ocker taught physical education in Snohomish, Washington. She then entered Smith College, where she received her M.S. degree in
1952 and served as an instructor of physical education. In 1955, she became
women's physical training instructor at the University of Texas and, in 1957,
joined Oregon State University as assistant professor of women's physical education. Professor Ocker came to Ann Arbor in 1961 as associate supervisor of
physical education for women and lecturer in the School of Education. She was
promoted to assistant professor in 1968, and in 1978 was named associate director of women's athletics. While teaching at the University, she continued her
studies, completing all course work toward a Ph.D. degree and collecting the data
for a dissertation.
During her tenure at the University of Michigan, Professor Ocker coached
many women's sports, including basketball, volleyball, and field hockey. She also
served as coordinator of teacher education, and, in addition to her administrative


-213 -



January Meeting 1992


duties, continued as a member of the physical education faculty, teaching courses
related to the history of human movement and physical education teaching methods for K-12 teacher certification.
Professor Ocker has served on numerous national, state, and University
committees, including the 1973 President's Committee to Study Women's Athletics. She has held many offices in the Michigan Association of Health, Physical
Education, Recreation, and Dance, including president, and has twice chaired the
Big Ten women's athletics directors. Within the University, she served on the
policy board of the Office of Student Services, the Michigan League Board of
Governors, and the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics.
Professor Ocker spearheaded women's athletics during a period of unprecedented growth and advancement. Among her many achievements, she initiated
the Academic Hall of Honor to recognize four-year varsity athletes who also excelled in the classroom.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Phyllis

471-473 Village Oaks, Ann Arbor
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved acceptance of a gift from Donald R. Shepherd of the
property at 471-473 Village Oaks in Ann Arbor. The property will be offered for
sale, and the proceeds, less any marketing costs, will go towards Mr. Shepherd's
$1.5 million pledge to endow a chair at the School of Music for the Michigan
Marching Band director.
President Duderstadt commented on the enormous impact Mr. Shepherd
has had on the University through his strong support of the Michigan Marching
Band.
Investments
Vice President Womack announced that the University's endowment portfolio had grown from $497 million in June, 1991 to $565 million as of January 15,
1992. He said that this reinforces the importance of staying in the stock market,
noting that 11 percent of the total value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average has
occurred in the last 20 days.
Reassignment of University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual Property (Jess G.
Thoene)
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Brown, all seven Regents present unanimously approved reassignment of the ownership of the intelrectual property "Cysteamine Treatment for AIDS" to Jess G. Thoene. Because


-214 -



January Meeting, 1992


the inventor of the intellectual property is also a University employee, this arrangement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the Assignment Agreement will be the Regents of the University of Michigan and Jess G. Thoene.
2.  The terms and pecuniary interests were previously disclosed to and
approved by the Regents on July 16, 1987, and are hereby incorporated by reference in this action request.
In response to a question from Regent Brown about the use of the term "reassignm  " Vice President Kelly stated that the reassi ent is by mutual consent. The inventor must reimburse the University for any costs up to that point,
and the University receives 15 percent of any royalties or equity arrangements
that the inventor subsequently receives. Regent Brown observed that the term
"reassign  t" in this context was inacurate; it is really an amendment to the
original agreement. Vice President Kelly said that he would consult with counsel
about a more appropriate way to describe these arrangements in the future.
Implementation of the Regents' Policy on Research Grants, Contracts, and
Agreements, FY91
Vice President Kelly informed the Regents that of the 2,807 research proposals submitted during FY91, twenty-three new requests for approval of contractual
restrictions on openness were received. Currently, there are three classified research projects at the University of Michigan.
There being no further business, the meeting was recessed at 2:55 P.M. to
await Public Comments at 4:00 PAM.
Public Comments
The Regents reconvened at 4:00 P.M. in the Regents' Room and heard comments from Thomas J. Nash, alumnus, about a class, "Comedy in Catholic Contexts".
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next meeting is scheduled for February 20 and 21, 1992. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses for the month of December
1991 totalled $477.78.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Wednesday, February 19,1992
Public Hearing on Transfer of Police Authority
The Regents met at 4:00 PA. in the Michigan League Ballroom for the purpose
of conducting a public hearing on the transfer of police authority, as required by
Public Act 120 of 1990. Present were President Duderstadt, Vice President and
Secretary Kennedy, and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Power, Nielsen, Smith, and
Varner. Because there was a demonstration in the room that made it impossible to
carry out the hearing as planned, Regent Power read the following motion:
Motion to recess and remove. In accordance with the decisions of the Michigan Appellate Courts in Regents v Washtenaw County Coalition Against Apartheid
and because the breach of the peace which has been committed at this meeting has
made it impossible to conduct the business of this meeting in an orderly fashion in
this location it is hereby moved that this meeting be recessed temporarily and
removed to the Alumni Center to be reconvened there at approximately 4:20 PM.
Although those who have committed a breach of the peace at this meeting will be
excluded from the reconvened meeting, representatives of the press will be
admitted and others having business at the reconvened meeting may be admitted as
space permits. University personnel shall be stationed at the doors to this meeting
room to advise the press and the public of this recess and the location of the
reconvened meeting.
Regent Baker seconded the motion, and it was adopted unanimously.
The hearing reconvened at approximately 4:20 PM. in the Alumni Center. Secretary Kennedy called on each speaker who had signed up in advance to address
the hearing, repeating the names of the speakers who had not responded after
gong through the list the first time. The Regents heard comments from the followmg 10 people, of the 24 speakers who had signed up to speak in advance: Aaron
Nobel, David Schwartz, Cameron Henke, Lynn Haley, Michael David Warren, Jr.,
David Marabel, Robert Van Houweling, and Raphael Zicklin, students; and Jim
Yu and Todd Strauch, staff members. Two additional scheduled speakers, Jeff
Hinte and Todd Ochoa (students), were present in the hearing room but chose not
to speak and left the room voluntarily.
The hearing ended at approximately 5:20 P.M., after all of the speakers who had
chosen to do so had spoken.
Thursday, Febnruary 20, 1992
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, and Varner.
Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice Presidents
Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones and
Wilson. Regent Waters and Vice President Cosovich were absent.

February Meeting, 1992


Comments regarding Vice President Hartford. President Duderstadt welcomed Maureen Hartford, Vice President for Student Affairs, to her first Regents'
Meeting. Vice President Hartford commented on the week she had spent living
with a roommate in South Quad. She then apologized for the student demonstrations that had occurred the previous day, noting that although she valued the students' opinions, she disapproved of the methods they had used in shutting down the
open hearing. Her challenge would be to develop some mechanisms to help students learn more appropriate methods for stating their opinions.
Executive Session Motion
Regent Baker then made the following motion:
Pursuant to Sections 8(e) and 8(h) of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202,1 move that the Board of Regents meet in closed session
on February 21, 1992, at 8:30 A.M. in the Regents' Room, Fleming Administration
Building, for the purpose of considering material exempt from discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. Such exempt material consists
of consulting with the Board's legal counsel in connection with specific pending litigation.
Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
University of Michigan Hospitals Comparative Statistic Report
Vice President Womack introduced Mr. John Forsyth, executive director of
University of Michigan Hospitals, who noted that the purpose of this report was to
compare and contrast UM Hospitals' performance of the previous year to that of its
peers: the 22 AA-rated hospitals, the 421 other teaching hospitals, and 1,677 other
hospitals across the country. The comparisons are based on FY 1991 performance
and performance for the first six months of FY 1992, and measures used include
profitability, liquidity, capital structure, and patient activity.
Mr. Forsyth noted that in 1991 the Hospitals made $36 million, almost double
what it had made the previous year. He noted that in general the Hospitals had
made significant improvement in profitability measures relative to AA hospitals,
and had also made significant improvement over the national average of teaching
institutions. Liquidity figures had also shown marked improvement, with the
number of days in accounts receivable having decreased by 13 days from the previous year, while other institutions' days had increased.
Following some discussion about accounts receivable statistics, Mr. Forsyth discussed the capital structure and patient activity statistics. He noted that the Hospitals occupancy rate in FY 1991 was 30 percent higher than the national average and
20 percent higher than that for the average of teaching hospitals.
Mr. Forsyth then turned to a review of the Hospitals' performance during the
first six months of the current fiscal year, July 1-December 31, 1991. He noted that
patient caregivers comprise 69 percent of FTE employees, and non-caregivers comprise 31 percent. In March 1991, the number of FTE staff was frozen at the level of
6,813. By January 1992, the number of FTE employees had decreased by 208


-218 -



February Meeting, 1992


employees. However, the reduction in force process used to accomplish this has
had a net result of only 16 employees being unplaced, with only 8 of those being unemployed at the current time.
Mr. Forsyth concluded that even with no room rate increase, the cost per case
thus far in FY 1992 has been reduced both below the budgeted amount and below
the level of the previous year.
In the discussion that followed, Regents Baker and Power complimented Mr.
Forsyth and his staff for their superior performance in managing the University of
Michigan Hospitals. Regent Power asked that two questions be addressed at some
future time: 1) the national phenomenon of the rise in health care costs and how
the Hospitals would be affected by any national health care plans that might be established; and 2) the responsibility of public universities to help control steadily increasing health care costs, and specifically, what the Medical School and Hospitals
are doing to control these costs. Mr. Forsyth observed that his report had already
detailed some of the Hospitals' responses to the latter question.
1992-93 Residence Hall and Family Housing Rates
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Hartford to introduce the proposed 1992-93 residence hall and family housing rates. Vice President Hartford introduced Mr. Robert Hughes, director of housing, to present the proposal.
Mr. Hughes said that the Housing Division supports the recommendations of
the Single Student and Family Housing Rate Study Committees to increase both
residence hall and family housing rates for 1992-93 by an average of 4.9 percent, a
figure expected to closely parallel the inflation rate. The request includes no new
initiatives; however, there is a slight increase in the per capita allocation to capital
reserve accounts, and the family housing rates include an increase in the voluntary
contribution to the Ann Arbor public schools.
Mr. Hughes discussed some of the goals of the Housing Division, which include
making residence halls rates as competitive and cost-efficient as possible over the
long term. Two of the Housing Division's goals for the year 2000 are to be at the
leading edge nationally in terms of service, programs, technology, and staff support,
and to ensure the division's continued fiscal integrity while having a building mventory with a remaining useful life of 30 years by the year 2000.
He noted that the campus-wide Total Quality Management effort is particularly relevant to the Housing Division, with its wide variety of constituent groups,
and said that housing staff would be actively participating in this program as it
works toward a goal of remaining a national leader in its field into the 21st century.
He also noted the importance of housing's educational staff in enhancing the
out-of-classroom experience for students. From a competitive point of view, as
measured by other Big Ten and peer institutions, Mr. Hughes observed that the
University's package of programs, services, and facilities is one of the most comprehensive available anywhere.
Mr. Hughes concluded his presentation by pointing out the importance of
maintenance of housing's physical plant, and by noting the success of the program


-219 -



February Meeting, 1992


instituted last year that offers a number of meal plan and food service options both
to students who live in residence halls and those who live off campus.
There followed a discussion of issues raised in Mr. Hughes' pres entation, including the meal programs, the necessity of a 5 percent reserve rate, and the effect
of the rental market on residence hall occupancy In response to questions from
Regent Varner, Vice President Hartford observed that students today have different backgrounds, needs, and expectations for their residence hall experience than
did students of previous generations, and that issues such as expected advances in
technology require that future needs be planned for now. In response to a question
from Regent Baker, Mr. Hughes observed that residence hal occupancy is currently at 100 percent, with 99 percent of freshmen choosing to live in residence
halls.
Regent Smith asked why the Michigan League wasn't included in last year's
Fmerger of North Campu Commons and the Michigan Union into the Housing Division. Vice President Womack responded that it had not been discussed at that
time, but that this possibility is currently being considered.
At the end of the discussion, it was noted that the vote on the housing rate increase would be taken the following day.
Minutes
Consideration of the minutes of the January 1992 meeting was delayed until
the following month.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports on Investment Transactions, Plant
Extension, Litigation, and Personnel-Labor Relations. He pointed out the effect
that low interest rates are having on the University Investment Pool.
Regent Baker observed that the University contributes to the tax base of the
city of Ann Arbor in many ways, due to the large number of its employees who own
houses in the city and its voluntary contribution to the public schools for North
Campus housing families who attend public school.
Vice President Kelly submitted reports on Summaries of a Selection of Current
Research and Sponsored Projects and Projects Established, Research and Other
Academic Activities.
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents voted
to receive the reports.
Voluntary Support
Noting that Vice President Cosovich was out of town, President Duderstadt
presented the Report of Gifts Received and Listing of Gifts of $5,000 and above for
January 1992. Regent Baker expressed his gratitude for the ongoing support of the
Ford family and Ford Motor Company for the University of Michigan- Dearborn.

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents voted
unanimously to adopt the following retirement memoirs:
Eugene Arden, professor of English and former provost and vice chancellor for
academic affairs at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, retired from           active
faculty status on December 31, 1991, after 19 years of distinguished service to the
University of Michigan.
A native of New York City, Professor Arden received his BA           degree from
New York University in 1944, his M.A      degree from Columbia University in 1947,
and his Ph.D. degree from Ohio State University in 1953. After serving as
supervisor of instruction at the English Language Institute of Queens College from
1955-57, he then joined the faculty of Long Island University as an assistant
professor, rising to the ranks of associate professor in 1959 and professor in 1961.
At Long Island University, Professor Arden also served as chair of the Department
of English at C.W. Post College from 1957-62, director of the Humanities Division
from 1960-62, dean of the college at C.W. Post from 1962-64, university dean of the


-233 -



February Meeting, 1992


graduate faculties of arts and science from 1964-70, and executive dean of the
Brooklyn Center from 1970-72.
Professor Arden came to the University of Michigan-Dearborn in 1972 as
professor of English and as the campus's first vice chancellor and dean of academic
affairs. In 1989, his administrative title was changed to provost and vice chancellor
for academic affairs; he served in that position through December 31, 1990o As the
chief academic officer at UM-Dearbom, Professor Arden had a profound impact,
which extended throughout the Dearborn campus and beyond to the broader
University of Michigan community. As the principal architect of the academic
programs of the institution, his influence on the development of the campus was
pervasive.
The author of over 50 publications, Professor Arden's scholarly interests range
from the impact of urbanization on literature to curriculum development, teaching
improvement, administration and, most recently, university governance and faculty
development. He serves as a member of several national professional
organizations and has been a guest speaker at a number of commencements and
professional meetings. In November 1991, he was named editor of Academe, the
journal of the American Association of University Professors.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member and gifted administrator for his dedicated service by naming Eugene Arden Professor Emeritus of
English and Provost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Emeritus.
Guenther H. E. Elste, associate professor of astronomy, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1991, after a long career as a teacher and researcher.
Born in Jauer, Schlesien, Germany, in 1923, Professor Elste completed both his
undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of GUttingen, starting in 1946.
He received the Ph.D. degree in astronomy at GUttingen in 1954.
Professor Elste's computing skills and knowledge of solar spectroscopy brought
him to the University of Michigan in 1954, where he served first as a research
assistant and then as a research associate until 1956. At that time, Leo Goldberg,
Edith Muller, and Lawrence Aller were working on their monumental determination of abundances in the sun, one of the most often cited astrophysical papers of
its day. While Professor Elste was too junior to be a principal author on that paper
at that time, a major portion of it made use of his computer programs and
numerical algorithms. Professor Elste returned to GUttingen in 1956, where he
served as an assistant in science at the University Observatory until 1962.
In addition to solar research, Professor Elste made pioneering calculations related to the atmospheres and abundances of stellar spectra. By the time he returned to the University of Michigan as an assistant professor, in 1962, he was established as a leader in the field of analytical astronomical spectroscopy. He was
promoted to associate professor in 1968, and was a popular doctoral dissertation
chair. Between 1962 and 1971, he directed nine doctoral students through the completion of the Ph.D.
Professor Elste's work has always been characterized by care and reliability.
For nearly a decade, his solar "Model 10" was the atmosphere of choice among
abundance workers. His interest in the structure of stellar atmospheres and their
spectra has continued throughout his career. The author of numerous publications,
his most recent paper was accepted by the Astrophysical Journal in the fall of 1991.
The Regents now salute this distinguished astronomer for his dedicated service
by naming Guenther H. E. Elste Associate Professor Emeritus of Astronomy.

February Meeting, 1992


Ernest Fontheim, research scientist in the Space Physics Research Laboratory,
Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences, College of Engineering,
retired from active faculty status on December 31, 1991, after a productive career
as a researcher and teacher.
A native of Germany, Dr. Fontheim began his studies of physics and mathematics at the University of Berlin and the Technical University of Berlin-Charlottenburg after the end of World War II. He emigrated to the United States in 1947
and received his B.S. degree (physics) and A.B. degree (mathematics) from Southwest Missouri State College in 1950. He continued his studies and earned his M.S.
degree (hysics) in 1952 and his Ph.D. degree (physics) in 1960, both from Lehigh
University.
Dr. Fontheim joined the University of Michigan as an associate research scientist in 1960 in the Radiation Laboratory of the Department of Electrical Engineering and in 1962 accepted a position with the Space Physics Research Laboratory.
In 1963, he was promoted to research scientist.
Dr Fontheim's research activities were mainly concerned with the plasma physical aspects of ionospheric and magnetospheric phenomena. In the 1960s, he was
the first to publish calculations of the effects of the energy degradation of precipitating auroral electrons in the atmosphere. He later extended this research to predict anomalous transport effects in the upper ionosphere due to wave-partical interactions involving the precipitating auroral electrons and worked at various aspects of such transport effects. Also, he carried out research on the interaction of
the solar wind with the planet Venus.
In addition to being a productive researcher, Dr. Fontheim was active in educational and service activities. He taught a number of courses in both the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and
Space Sciences, where he introduced a new course on the solar wind and
magnetosphere. He served on a number of departmental, university, and national
committees, most recently on the University of Michigan Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty. Dr. Fontheim held a National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council Senior Postdoctoral Research Associateship at
the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 1972 and again during the 1983-84 academic year. He has been appointed as a visiting scientist at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research, the Space Science Laboratory of the University of California, and the Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environment terrestre et
Planetaire in Paris. Dr. Fontheim also served as staff scientist, Solar System Exploration Division, NASA, and has lectured the Max Planck Institut fur Aeronomie in
Lindau, Federal Republic of Germany, the Space Research Institute of the Polish
Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, the Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications in Paris, and the Institut d'Aeronomie Spatiale de Belgique in Brussels.
The Regents now salute this distinguished space scientist for his long and productive service by naming Ernest G. Fontheim Research Scientist Emeritus.
Norma L Radin, professor of social work, retired on December 31, 1991, after
23 years of service to the University of Michigan.
A native of New York City, Professor Radin received her B.A. degree from
Brooklyn College in 1946, her MA degree from Columbia University in 1948, and
her M.S.W. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1965 and 1969,
respectively. She joined the faculty of the School of Social Work in 1968 as a


-235 -



February Meeting 1992


lecturer, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1969, associate professor in
1971, and professor in 1976.
Professor Radin is recognized as a leading scholar in the area of child development and parenting, with particular emphasis on the nontraditional family. Much
of her recent academic research has focused on determining the influence of
fathers and grandfathers on young children. She has writte extensively on early
childhood education interventions. Professor Radin received particular recognition
as an expert in school social work; she served for over 20 years as the School of
Social Work faculty member designated to recommend graduates for certification
as school social workers in the state of Michigan. Her retirement marks the
departure of an esteemed member of the faculty of the School of Social Work who
was devoted to identifying influential factors in early childhood development
The Regents now salute Norma L Radin by namg her Professor Emeritus of
Social Work.
Memorial
Provost Whitaker reported the death of one faculty member. Regent Power
moved, Regent Nielsen seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, adoption of the following memorial:
The Regents of the University acknowledge with profound sadness the death
on December 4, 1991, of Betty Jean Davis, associate professor in the Registered
Nurse Studies Program in the School of Nursing.
Professor Davis was born in Decatur, Alabama on May 24, 1943. She attended
the Tuskegee Institute, receiving her B.S. degree in nursing in 1967 and staying on
to teach at the School of Nursing there from 1968-70. In June 1968, she married
Dr. George C. Davis and two years later she and her family moved to Ann Arbor.
She received her master's degree in psychiatric nursing in 1972 from the University
of Michigan. She then entered the Program in Educational Psychology, where she
earned her Ph.D. degree in 1973. Professor Davis held the position of associate
professor at Eastern Michigan University; since 1974, she has been in a similar
position at the University of Michigan.
Within the School of Nursing, Professor Davis taught graduate courses in psychiatric nursing. Her scholarly work focused on issues of advanced education, nursing education, and mental health nursing. Along with her teaching and research
responsibilities at the University, Professor Davis had a private practice in Christian psychology counseling. This practice provided an opportunity for her to minister to numerous troubled individuals and families. As the type of person that
would sacrifice her own needs to take care of those of other, she made a deep impression on those she helped.
Professor Davis died at her home after struggling for some time to overcome
the effects of her illness. She will be sorely missed by those who knew and loved
her. Our condolences go to her husband George, their children George and Erika;
her mother, Dorothy Guinn; her grandmother, Patti.Bibb of Decatur, Alabama; her
sisters, Valire Howard of Louisville, Kentucky, Carglon Nance of Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma, and Patti Camel of Decatur, Alabama; her brothers, James Eaddy of
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Levi Nance, Jr., of Pontiac, Michigan, and Walter
Nance of Detroit, Michigan; four aunts and seven uncles.

Audited Financial Reports for WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUM-TV for
the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1991; Statements of Support, Revenue, and Expenditures for WFUM-TV and WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM for the Years Ended June
30, 1991 and 1990
Vice President Womack submitted audited financial reports for WUOM/
WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUM-TV for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1991. He
then called on Mr. Walter Harrison, executive director of University Relations, to
discuss the statements of support, revenue, and expenses for these operations.
Mr. Harrison noted that this had been a strong year for WFUM-TV, and he described the past year as a turn-around year for WUOM, with a surplus projected for
next year. He then responded to questions and comments from the Regents about
the possibilities for expanding coverage to the northern lower peninsula and the
upper peninsula, and about contracts for coverage of football and basketball
games. Regent Power asked that the Regents be provided with information on the
process followed by the athletic department for renewal of these contracts.
There being no further discussion, Regent Nielsen moved, Regent Brown seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, adoption of the audited financial
reports for WUOM/WVGR/WFUM-FM and WFUM-TV for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1991.

foreclosure since its inception. Thus it serves as a benefit to facult and staff while
providing a stable, relatively risk-free investment for the University  ndowment
Fund.
Florida Real Estate
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents voted
unanimously to accept a $110,000 cash offer submitted by Century 21-Remke
Realty, Inc, for propert located in Sun City Center, Florida. The proceeds, less
the realtor's commission and normal seller closing costs, will benefit the School of
Dentistry.
Renovations
Regent Baker moved, Regent Brown seconded, and the Regents unanimously
approved, the following renva    rojets: annal clsroomrenovation rov s;
renovation of space on the first floor of the Frieze Building; and renovation of
space on the second floor of the Space Research Building.

R Neubig)
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Nielsen, all seven Regents
present unanimously approved reassignment of the ownership of the intellectual
property "Pharmkin Software" to Richard R. Neubig. Because the inventor of the
intellectual property is also a University employee, this agreement falls under the
State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the assignment agreement will be the Regents of the
University of Michigan and Richard R. Neubig.
2.  The terms and pecuniary interests were previously disclosed to and
approved by the Regents on July 16, 1987, and are hereby incorporated by reference in this action request.
Reassignment of University's Ownership Interest in Intellectual Property (William
D. Ensminger, James A. Knol, and James C. Andrews)
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Baker, all seven Regents
present unanimously approved reassignment of the ownership of the intellectual
property "Cath-Link Vascular Access Port" to William D. Ensminger, James A.
Knol, and James C. Andrews. Because the employees/inventors of the intellectual
property are also University employees, this agreement falls under the State of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
-238 -



February Meeting, 1992


1.    Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Drs.
Ensminger, Knol, and Andrews.
2.    Terms of the contract include: standard terms in accordance with
those previously disclosed to and approved by the Regents on July
16, 1987, with the exception that the employee/inventors will pay
the University 23 percent of the royalties they receive in lieu of the
standard 15 percent. The increased royalty rate is in recognition of
previous University efforts to conclude a license option with a
medical products company. Duration of the agreement will be for
the life of the last to expire of the patents being reassigned. There
is no assignment of University employees or use of University
facilities or services included in the contract or required for
fulfillment of the contract (i.e., the reassignment agreement).
3.    Drs. Ensminger, Knol, and Andrews' pecuniary interest in the contract arises from their right to receive royalties on future sales
covered by the patent rights to be reassigned. Drs. Ensminger,
Knol, and Andrews' share of royalties from the licensee will be in
lieu of participation in the sharing of royalties received by the
University in accordance with University policy.
Medical Staff Appointments
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent McFee, and on the recommendation of the executive board of the University of Michigan Hospitals, the
Regents unanimously approved several appointments to medical staff membership.
The meeting recessed at 3:45 P.M. to move to the Michigan Union Ballroom for
the second public hearing.
Public Hearing on Transfer of Police Authority
The Regents met at 4:00 P.M. in the Michigan Union Ballroom for the purpose
of conducting a public hearing on the transfer of police authority, as required by
Public Act 120 of 1990. Present were President Duderstadt, Vice President and
Secretary Kennedy, and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Power, Nielsen, Smith, and
Varner.
President Duderstadt called on the first speaker, Mr. Jon Falk. Because there
was a demonstration in the room, Mr. Falk was not able to make himself heard,
and it became impossible to carry out the hearing as planned. Therefore, Regent
Power read the following motion:
Motion to recess and remove. In accordance with the decisions of the Michigan Appellate Courts in Regents v Washtenaw County Coalition Against Apartheid
and because the breach of the peace which has been committed at this meeting has
made it impossible to conduct the business of this meeting in an orderly fashion in
this location, it is hereby moved that this meeting be recessed temporarily and removed to the Regents' Room, to be reconvened there at approximately 4:20 P.M.
Although those who have committed a breach of the peace at this meeting will be


-239 -



February Meeting, 1992


excluded from the reconvened meeting, representatives of the press will be
admitted and others having business at the reconvened meeting may be admitted as
space permits. University personnel shall be stationed at the doors to this meeting
room to advise the press and the public of this recess and the location of the
reconvened meeting. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was adopted.
The hearing reconvened at approximately 4:20 PM. in the Regents' Room. The
following individuals addressed the Regents: Jon Falk, staff; Joe Diederich, staff;
Karrin Kober, student; Amy Spade, student; Bill VanDoornik, staff; Susan McGee,
executive director of the Domestic Violence Project, Inc.; Brenton House, student;
Joel Strimling, student; Susan Pollay, director of the Ann Arbor Summer Festival;
Randy Frank, staff; Amy Polk, student; and Elizabeth Shaw, student.
The hearing ended at about 5:10 P.M.
Friday, February 21, 1992
The Regents met in closed session at 8:30 AM, and reconvened in public session, in the Regents' Room, at 9:30 AM. Present were President Duderstadt and
Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner, and Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice Presidents Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones and Wilson.
Vice President Cosovich was absent.
Colleges and Universities Public Safety Officers Act: Empowerment of Peace and
Police Officers
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order, and called on Vice President
Womack, who stated that the action request was described in the Regents communication. Regent Nielsen moved that the Regents authorize the empowerment of
peace and police officers in the Department of Public Safety and delegate the authority to grant such powers to the vice president and chief financial officer and his
written designees, as described in the Regents communication. Regent Power
seconded the motion.
Regent Brown expressed his support of the motion, and observed that safety officers under the University's jurisdiction would be much more responsive to the
needs of students and staff, and that this is one step in a program of increasing
campus safety for students.
Regent Nielsen said that the Regents are obligated to provide the most secure,
safe premises possible for students, both today and in the future. Providing a
security force that is answerable to the University community and not to some
other agency enables the Regents to carry out their obligation, and he was strongly
in support of the action.
Regent McFee pointed out that this was only a technical change in jurisdiction
of the existing deputized police force, and it would give the University an opportunity to work with concerned students to get their input on security issues.


-240 -



February Meeting, 1992


Regent Smith observed that she did not condone the behavior of the students
who had demonstrated the previous two days, but believed that some of the students she had spoken with had some valid concerns. Among these were the lack of
a democratic process, and she asked Vice President Hartford to address this.
Vice President Hartford stated that mechanisms need to be developed that get
students included earlier in processes such as appointments to committees and expressing their opinions to the Regents, and that she would work with students to
achieve these goals.
In response to other questions raised by Regent Smith on behalf of concerns
that had been expressed at the hearings, Mr. William Krumm, associate vice president for business operations, stated that the University's police force consists of
four Black officers, one Hispanic officer, and nine white officers, of which twelve
are male and two are female. Sworn supervisors include one Black and nine
whites. There are currently twenty-four police officers, including supervisors. Mr.
Krumm reported that there is not a separate police budget The Department of
Public Safety's budget was increased by $500,000 in the first year following
deputization; in the second year it was increased by $600,000.
On the issue of whether there is differential enforcement of a requirement for
producing identification to attend student-sponsored events at the Michigan Union,
Regent Baker and Vice President Hartford gave examples where white students
and staff who had no identification were denied admission. As for whether there
had been student involvement into the formulation and enforcement of this policy,
Vice President Hartford reported that a committee consisting predominantly of
students had been meeting regularly for some months and was continually
re-evaluating how to best handle security issues involving the Michigan Union.
Regent Brown emphasized that the Regents wanted to ensure that there would
not be discriminatory action taken at the Michigan Union, and noted that there is a
mechanism in place for handling individual complaints. Regent Varner observed
that historically, Black people have had generally very negative experiences with
police forces, and that this was a factor in the perceptions of many Black students
about a campus police force. She asked for assurances that the police training
would include adequate sensitivity training and understanding of this issue.
Regent Power observed that the issue was not whether to deputize campus
police, but what body should have jurisdiction over them. To achieve the desired
outcome of having the safest possible campus, it must have the best possible police
force, carefully selected and well-trained.
Regent Varner noted the concerns raised at the hearings about jurisdictional
issues between the campus and Ann Arbor police forces, and asked for more information about how the oversight board would operate. Provost Whitaker responded
that the election procedure has been worked out for faculty and staff and that the
student process was still being developed, in conjunction with MSA. The elected
board is charged with investigation of complaints against police officers, while the
already existing appointed board, which is larger and more broadly-representative
of campus constituencies, would be continued and would deal with policy questions.

February Meeting 1992


Regent Baker recalled an incident that had occurred at a Regents' meeting a
number of years ago, during which someone had been arrested by the Ann Arbor
police. He expressed support for the motion, noting that if the University had had
its own police force at that time, the arrest might have been avoided.
There being no further discussion, the vote was then taken, and the motion was
approved, with Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Varner, and Waters
in favor and Regent Smith opposed.
1992 Residence Hall and Family Housing Rates
Regent Nielsen moved approval of the proposed 1992-93 residence hall and
family housing rates, at an increase of 4.9 percent over the 1991-92 rates. Regent
Brown seconded the motion, and after some discussion, it was adopted
unanimously.
School of Social Work Dean
Regent Smith moved, Regent Brown seconded, and the Regents unanimously
approved, the appointment of Paula Allen Meares as dean of the School of Social
Work and professor of social work, with tenure, effective February 1, 1993.
Comments by Regent Smith
Regent Smith announced that she would be seeking re-election to the Board of
Regents.
The meeting then recessed and reconvened in the Anderson Room of the
Michigan Union to hear Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the findividuals ones  the ing ndduas on topics indicated: Kim Mackenzie, alumnus, smoking in the Michigan Stadium; Julie Helling,
student, being a lesbian law student; Alice Hamele, citizen, treatment received at
the dental school; Charles Tackett, citizen, codes and policies; Carrie Klis, student
and member of ACT-UP Ann Arbor, AIDS policies at UM Hospitals; and Safiya
Khalid, citizen, the Michigan Union.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 11:35 A.M. The
next meeting is scheduled for March 12 and 13, 1992. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses for the month of January
1992 totalled $1,87833.

campus of the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner, and
Waters. Vice President and Secretary Kennedy and Vice Presidents Cosovich,
Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones and

members of the UM-Dearbom community for hosting the Regents' meeting.
Proposed Research Subcontract between the University of Michigan and Anjoy
Research, Inc.
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Brown, all seven Regents
present unanimously approved a proposed r research subcontract between the
University of Michigan and Anjoy Research, Inc. Because the president and
chairman of the board of Anjoy Research, Inc., Claes G. Fornell and Michael J.
Ryan, are also University employees, this arrangement falls under the State of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the agreement will be Anjoy Research, Inc., and the Regents of the University of Michigan. Professor Michael J. Ryan
will sign the contract on behalf of Anjoy.
2.  The proposed subcontract will be consistent with University research policies. There will be no restrictions on publication or
openness of the research. The subcontract will cover the period
July 1, 1991, through December 31, 1992, at an estimated cost of
$336,743 including 57 percent indirect cost. Fifty percent of a
graduate student's salary and related fringe benefits will be covered as well as 60 percent of Dr. Fornell's salary. The dean's office
will appoint a project director other than Fornell or Ryan.
3.  The total contract to Anjoy is approximately $940,000. Drs.
Fornell and Ryan represent that they receive no salary from Anjoy
for their efforts on the project. Fomell, Ryan, and their spouses
each own 25 percent of Anjoy.
Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and Theragen,
Inc.
Regent Smith moved, Regent Power seconded, and all seven Regents present
unanimously approved, the University's entering into a license agreement with
Theragen, Inc., through which to develop and commercialize a new approach to


-243 -



March Meeting, 1992


gene therapy ("technology"). Because the principals of Theragen, Inc., are or
were at the time the technology was invented University employees, this arrangement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the Regents of the University of
Michigan and Theragen, Inc., a corporation owned in part by the
principals.
2.  Terms of the contract include: a duration for the term of the last
to expire of the licensed patents (or the earlier of January 1,2003,
or seven years from the date of the first commercial sale, if a
longer term would thereby arise), and consideration to the University consisting of payment of royalties, including minimum royalties, on sales of the technology and on sublicensed rights granted in
the technology. Royalties will be paid at a rate of 5 percent for
revenues from the sale or use of patented technology, 3 percent for
revenues from the sale or use of unpatented technology, and 25
percent of revenues generated by sublicenses in the technology
provided Theragen remains located within the state of Michigan,
or 30 percen of revenue generated by sublicenses in the technology if Theragen moves outside the state of Michigan. Minimum
royalties shall commence in 1996; such minimum royalties shall be
$20,000 in 1996, $30,000 in 1997, and $50,000 in 1998 and thereafter during the duration of the agreement. The University retains
ownership of the technology, and will be assigned joint ownership
of any inventions relating to the technology which are created
jointly by University employees and Theragen employees, and will
also be assigned sole ownership of any inventions relating to the
technology which are created solely by University employees who
are concurrently employed by Theragen. The University retains
the right to use the technology for research and educationallyrelated purposes. Theragen shall make reasonable efforts to
pursue the commercial development and exploitation of the technology. There is no use of facilities or services of the University
included in the contract and no assignment of University employees for fulfillment of the contract.
3.  The principals' pecuniary interest in the contract arises from their
ownership of Theragen. This corporation will receive revenues
from the sale, use, and sublicensing of the technology, and the University will receive a share of those revenues. The principals' interest in that corporation will be in lieu of participation in the
sharing of royalties received by the University in accordance with
University policy. Dr. Goins, a developer of the technology but
not a principal of Theragen, will remain eligible to participate in
an appropriate percentage portion, based on his agreed-upon contribution to the technology, of the applicable inventors' share of
royalties that may result from the proposed Theragen license
agreement.

March Meeting, 1992


Annual Report on Investments as of December 31, 1991
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Womack, who introduced Mr.
Norman Herbert, the University's investment officer, and Mr. David Thurston of
Cambridge Associates, the University's investment advisor.
Mr. Herbert reviewed the Report of Investments as of December 31, 1991.
He noted that the Donor Pooled Income fund is an investment pool for charitable remainder trusts. During 1991, the market value of this fund increased from
$3.3 million to $4.2 million. he objective of this fund is to provide income of at
least 6 percent while protecting the purchasing power of the distribution to the
beneficiaries and the fund's principal, in which the University has a charitable remainder interest. In ten years time, the income objective has been met, and the
real value of the fund has been enhanced.
Regarding the University Investment Pool, the strategy in 1991 was to stabilize returns during a period of sharp declines in short term interest rates. This
fund yielded 7.8 percent, which compares favorably with the 5.7 percent average
for money market mutual funds. The UIP is the investment fund for the University's working capital, and its objective is to provide a stable level of income consistent with the preservation of principal, while offering participants daily liquidity. During 1991, this fund provided investment income of $61 million.
The University Endowment Fund, which had a 25.8 percent return in 1991,
went from $431.6 million at December 31, 1990, to $562.5 million at December
31, 1991. Of this, $50.4 million was newly invested money, and $26 million of the
investment returns was distributed to participants. A ten-year history of this fund
shows that it had a beginning value of $110.7, contributions of $317.0, reinvested
returns of $134.8, and distributed returns of $156.1. The long term goal of the
University Endowment Fund is to maintain and enhance the purchasing power of
the principal and of the stream of distribution. In 1991, the real value of this
fund was enhanced by 17.5 percent. Over the past ten-year period, the real value
of the fund was enhanced by 3.5 percent per year.
Mr. Herbert then turned the meeting over to Mr. Thurston. Mr. Thurston reviewed the University's endowment strategies in the areas of asset allocation,
common stock management, and fixed income management. Referring to a
handout, he noted that during 1991 the University had consolidated its common
stock managers by adding one manager and deleting two managers. It had also
increased its exposure in the areas of international, real estate, oil and gas, and
venture capital investments. In fixed income investments, it had increased the alternative fixed income portfolio.
Regarding alternative asset investments, Mr. Thurston displayed a chart
showing how commitments had been increased, according to the direction of the
Regents, in the various alternative investment areas which comprise 12 percent
of the fund. He also illustrated how the common stock managers had performed
during recent cyclical variations in the stock market compared to the S&P 500
and the Russell 2000, as well as how the University's performance and allocations


-245 -



March Meeting, 1992


compared with Cambridge Associates' endowment mean, which includes 62 colleges and universities.
Common Stock Management of the University Endowment Fund: Capital
Growth Management
Mr. Thurston then introduced a request to appoint Capital Growth
Management as an investment manager of the University Endowment Fund. He
pointed out the excellent, long-term record of this company's stock portfolio
manager, G. Kenneth Heebner. In response to a question from Regent Power,
Vice President Womack noted that investment managers are chosen on the basis
of individual managers' performance, not on the reputation of the company they
work for. If there were changes in the individual personnel managing the
University's portfolio in any of investment managers, his staff would carefully
consider whether to stay with that company. Following further discussion,
Regent Power moved, Regent Varner seconded, and the Regents unanimously
approved the appointment of Capital Growth Management as an investment
manager for the University Endowment Fund.
Minutes
Regent Baker moved approval of the minutes of the meetings of January 16,
1992 and February 18, 19, and 20, 1992, pending the incorporation of previously
agreed-upon changes to the January minutes. Regent Smith seconded the
motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Regent Brown left the meeting at approximately 2:10 P.M.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports of Investment Transactions, University Endowment Fund Quarterly Inventory and Performance as of December
31, 1991, Plant Extension, Litigation, and Personnel-Labor Relations.
Vice President Kelly submitted reports of Projects Established, Research and
Other Academic Activities, and Summaries of a Selection of Current Research
and Sponsored Projects.
Voluntary Support
Vice President Cosovich submitted a report of gifts received for the month of
February 1992 and commented on the status of gift receipts for the current fiscal
year as compared to the last. On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by
Regent Waters, the Regents unanimously approved receipt of the following gifts,
with thanks, and in accord with their terms and conditions:
AT&T Foundation, New York. New York

Joseph Hospital in Mt. Clemens, Michigan, and from 1958-62, she also worked
part-time as a research psychologist at the Rehabilitation Institute in Detroit. In
1962, she joined the Jackson public schools, where she worked for a year as a
school psychologist. After serving as an assistant professor at Case Western
Reserve University from 1966-70, Professor Morrison joined the University of
Michigan School of Education as an associate professor of education in 1970; she
was promoted to professor in 1974.
During her years with the School of Education, Professor Morrison taught
courses in educational psychology, statistics, and research design. She also

March Meeting, 1992


worked extensively on a one-to-one basis with her graduate students, assisting
them with writing and publishing research articles and reports. Her student
evaluations were consistently excellent and she received kudos from students and
colleagues on a regular basis. Professor Morrison served on a number of School
of Education and University-wide committees, including the Commission on
Women, the Committee on the Status of Women in Graduate Education, and the
Research Advisory Board of the Center for Afroamerican Studies.
During her career, Professor Morrison has been very active with various professional organizations, including the American Educational Research Association, for which she regularly presented papers at its annual meetings. She was
honored by that organization in 1985 as a "Distinguished Researcher and
Scholar." Professor Morrison's "Joint Hampton-Michigan Project" (with Professor Wilbert McKeachie), funded by NIE in the late seventies, was held in high
regard as an exemplary educational training project
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator by naming Betty M.
Morrison Professor Emeritus of Education.
Memorials
No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
University Endowment Fund
Vice President Womack commented that $317 million had been donated to
the University over the past ten years by individuals and coorations, largely
from the state of Michigan. He pointed out that the life blood of an endowment
is giving, and that it is a tribute to the people and corporations in the state and
nation that they have been willing to give to the University. A lot of the credit
for the growth m the endowment should be given to Vice President Cosovich and
the deans and others in the University who work hard to maintain the level of
contributions.

March Meeting, 1992


the University of Michigan for the year ended June 30, 1991. This report contains information about receipts and expenditures from and by booster and
alumni organizations on behalf of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, and is required by NCAA Bylaw 6.2, Section 3.1.
Mr. Carl Smith, director of University Audits, responded to questions about
the audit. Following some discussion, Regent Power asked to receive a report of
the historical pattern of booster activities related to the Department of
Intercollegiate Athletics. He also suggested that it might be helpful to have the
director of Intercollegiate Athletics address the Regents about fundraising activities in the department.
Resolution Authorizing the Issuance of Declarations of Intent to Reimburse the
Regents for Project Expenditures from the Proceeds of Bonds
Vice President Womack and Mr. Herbert explained that passage of this resolution is required to meet regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service on
January 27, 1992. These regulations list three general requirements which must
be met by a tax-exempt bond issuer (see Regents communication for details).
Following some discussion, Regent Power moved, Regent Waters seconded,
and all six Regents present unanimously approved the following resolution, which
designates the vice president and chief financial officer to issue declarations of
intent to reimburse the Regents for project expenditures from the proceeds of
bonds.
Resolution of the Regents of the University of Michigan Authorizing
the Issuance of Declarations of Intent to Reimburse the Regents
for Project Expenditures from the Proceeds of Bonds
WHEREASM the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") is a constitutional body
corporate established pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as
amended, with genera supervision of the University of Michigan (the University") and the control
and direction ofall expenditures from the Universitys funds; and
WHEREAS, the United States Treasury has issued regulations7 codified as Treas. Reg. Section
1.103-18 (the "Reulations"), requiring the prior declaration of an issuer's intent to reimburse itself
from debt proceeds for expenditures paid pnrior to the issuance of the debt obligations; and
WHEREAS, the Regulations specifically permit a bond issuer to delegate to a person the power

University of Michigan Hospitals Mott Renewal Project
Vice President Womack reported that the design documents for the Mott
Renewal Project had been completed and that Certificate of Need approval had


-256 -



March Meeting, 1992


been received from the Michigan Department of Public Health. This is a request
for approval of the project budget of $49 million (except for demolition of the
Women's Hospital Building as part of Phase n), issuance of bids, and award of
contract.
Regent Smith moved approval of the project budget, authorization for the issuance of the two phases or bids, and the award of construction contracts, providing the contract values are within the approved budget. Regent Power seconded the motion.
Vice President Womack responded to questions from Regent Baker about
the budget for the Mott Renewal Project. Following some discussion, the vote
was taken and the motion was approved unanimously.
Research Projects at the University of Michigan-Dearborn
President Duderstadt noted that earlier in the day the Regents and executive
officers had toured the renovated science building and new computing wing, and
had seen presentations about current research projects in biology and in electrical and computer engineering (descriptions of which are contained in the Regents' agenda).
Chancellor Wilson observed that these projects represented a validation of
the campus' mission in that it illustrated research that has applied characteristics,
is useful for undergraduate instruction and undergraduate participation in
research, and also serves the traditional academic needs of faculty for publishing
the results of their research.
University Musical Society Board of Directors
On a motion by Regent Baker, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
voted unanimously to confirm the election of George Shirley, Leon Cohan, Iva
Wilson, and Carol Smokier as directors of the University Musical Society.
The meeting recessed at 3:00 P.M. At that time, Chancellor Wilson invited
the meeting participants to tour the Henry Ford Estate.
Public Comments
The meeting reconvened at 3:30 P.M. for Public Comments. The Regents
heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics indicated: Donald
L. Knapp, Jr., UM-D student, on potential tuition increases; Andrea Mayes
Krueger, member of Washtenaw County Literacy Community Outreach, on a
literacy forum to be held at Washtenaw Community College; John V. Berry and
William B. Anaya, UM-D students, on the need for increased state funding at
UM-Dearborn; Paula Labbe, UM-D student, about settlement of the Joseph
Wright case involving the Michigan Journal; and Matthew Kapell, UM-D student
and delegate to the Michigan Collegiate Coalition, on tuition increases.

APRIL MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, April 16, 1992
The Regents met at 1:10 PM. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, and Varner. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice Presidents Cosovich, Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones
and Wilson. Regent Waters was absent; Regent Brown joined the meeting at
1:20 PM.
Michigan Student Assembly
President Duderstadt noted that new officers had been elected for Michigan
Student Assembly; they will serve from April 1992 through April 1993. Vice
President Hartford introduced MSA president, Ede Fox, to the Regents and
officers. Ms. Fox said that she looked forward to working with everyone over the
coming year.
Motion to Meet in Executive Session
Regent Nielsen made the following motion:
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed session on April 16,
1992, immediately following the business portion of the Regents' Meeting in the
Regents' Room, for the purpose of consulting with the Board's attorney regarding trial
or settlement strategy in connection with specific pending litigation.
Regent Baker seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Resolution Honoring Michigan Wolverines Men's Basketball Team
Regent McFee offered the following resolution:
RESOLUTION
The Regents of the University of Michigan wish to commend the
Michigan Wolverine men's basketball team for their extraordinary season.
This basketball team, widely heralded from the start of the season as
the 'Fab Five," but in reality an entire team of players, coaches, and staff
dedicated to working together to achieve a common goal, astounded
basketball fans all season long. After finishing third in the Big Ten
Conference, they surprised sports pundits by winning the southeastern
regional championship with a thrilling overtime victory over Ohio State.
They went on to defeat the University of Cincinnati in the semi-finals
of the national championship, but fell one game short of their ultimate
goal losing the championship to number-one-ranked Duke University.


-259 -



April Meeting 1992


Their goal they said, was to "shock the world." Indeed, they did that
and more: They inspired Michigan alumni and fans everywhere by proving
that a team that sets goals and works hard to achieve them can succeed
against overwhelming odds. In doing so, they transcended sports by being
models for all of us in our daily lives.
The Regents salute the 1991-92 men's basketball team and look
forward to their fulfilling their dream in the years to come
Regent Nielsen seconded the motion, and it was adopted by acclamation.
Regent McFee noted that five Regents had attended the Final Four games, and
that all are proud of the way the team members, both individually and collectively, conducted themselves during that time.
Status of the 1992-93 State Budget Request
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Kennedy, who noted that the
governor was to issue an executive order that day which would exclude education
from proposed reductions of $200 million. However, the legislature must either
accept or reject the executive order, and some members feel that reductions
ought to be made across all sectors of the budget which would include higher
education. Therefore, it is hard to predictit  the  al outcome of the governor's
proposal.
President Duderstadt noted that like many states, Michigan is in the midst of
a fiscal crisis, but that even in the midst of deep budget cuts, the governor and
legislature have made education a priority. The governor's exemption of higher
education from his executive order reflects his continuing commitment to
education. The president reiterated the University's pledge to work with state
leaders in supporting the difficult actions that must be taken if Michigan is to
regain strength and prosperity. He expressed his appreciation for the decision to
make education a top priority in Michigan, which will enable the state to develop
its human resources to serve as the capital of the new economy.
Regent Nielsen observed that at the budget hearings, the possibility was
raised of utilizing the expertise of the University's faculty and staff to assist
legislators in dealing with the problems confronting them. He suggested that this
idea be explored further, as it would benefit both the state and perhaps local
governments as well as the University.
Vice President Kennedy pointed out that the Institute for Public Policy
Studies (IPPS) has held workshops for state legislators along the lines suggested
by Regent Nielsen, and he supported Regent Nielsen's suggestion as being a
useful way to utilize the University's resources to better serve the state.
Regent Baker observed that the state's current fiscal problems are similar to
those it faced during the early 1980s. He wanted to be sure that the legislature is
aware of the damage being done to the institution due to the fiscal constraints.
President Duderstadt reported that he and other University officials had
completed a videotaped discussion about many of the fiscal issues facing the


-260 -



April Meeting 1992


University, which would be aired on community access cable television in
upcoming weeks.
Minutes
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved the minutes of the meeting of January 16, 1992.
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent McFee, the Regents
unanimously approved the minutes of the meeting of March 12, 1992.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports on Investment Transactions, Plant
Extension, Litigation, and Personnel-Labor Relations. He also submitted a
Report on Non-Competitive Purchases over $2,000 from Single Sources from
January 1 through March 31, 1992.
Olympia & York Investment. With respect to the investment report, Vice
President Womack noted that the University Investment Pool has a $30 million
investment in Olympia & York Floating Rate First Mortgage Notes (now called
237 Park Avenue Associate Senior First Mortgage Notes). He emphasized that
the University is not an investor in any of Olympia & York's properties except for
three separately capitalized commercial properties in Manhattan. He called on
Mr. Norman Herbert, the University's investment officer, to comment.
Mr. Herbert reviewed information from a handout he distributed that explained the nature of the University's investment in the Olympia & York properties. He noted that the University's investment in these notes is secured by first
lien mortgages on all three properties and lease hold interests in addition on two
of the three properties, and that every monthly payment has been received by the
University during its holding period. Mr. Herbert explained further the extent
and cause of Olympia & York's current cash flow problems. He noted that the
market value of the University's Olympia & York investment represents about
2.3 percent of the investment pool, and that this is under the cap of 5.0 percent of
the pool's value in floating notes. Mr. Herbert concluded his remarks with
information about the cash flow and occupancy rates from the three buildings.
Regent Baker made further observations about Olympia & York, and noted
that he had opposed this investment because, as he recollected, it didn't follow
the basic criteria established by the Regents for bond investment. He pointed
out that the owners of the securities have the right to foreclose in the event of
nonpayment, and stated his expectation that staff would carefully evaluate this
option and proceed promptly with foreclosure if payments are not forthcoming.
Mr. Herbert confirmed that the University is in close contact with the trustee,
and would collaborate with the other noteholders in pursuing the options
available to them in the event of default, including foreclosure. He noted that
the buildings continue to represent excellent values, and that they are secured,
first mortgage lien interest notes.


-261 -



April Meeting 1992


There was further discussion of this issue, with comments by Regents Baker,
Varner, Power, Smith, and Brown. Mr. Herbert noted that the buildings had apprecated in value since the notes were originally issued, and that although real
estate values around the world had declined in recent years, they were especially
optimistic about the two properties in midtown New York City.
Vice President Womack emphasized that there is a downside risk to any investment, and the purpose of this discussion was to put on the record the
distinction between Olympia & York's general situation and the three properties
in which the University has exposure.
Following further discussion, Vice President Kelly submitted monthly reports
of Projects Established, Research and Other Activities, and Summaries of a
Selection of Current Research and Sponsored Projects. On a motion by Regent
Varner, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents voted unanimously to receive
the reports.

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents voted
unanimously to adopt the following retirement memoir:
Peter H. Amann, professor of history at the University of Michigan-Dearborn,
will retire from active faculty status on April 30, 1992.
A native of Austria, Professor Amann arrived in the United States as a refugee in 1941. He received his BA  degree with honors from Oberlin College in
1947. After stints as a salesman and machinist, he enrolled in the history graduate
program of the University of Chicago where he received his M.A. degree in 1953
and his Ph.D. degree in 1958. From 1956-59, he served as an instructor of history
at Bowdoin College and from 1959-65, as assistant and then associate professor at
Oakland University. He then went to the State University of New York at
Binghamton, before accepting an appointment as professor of history at the University of Michigan-Dearborn in 1968.
As a scholar, Professor Amann's interests range from French to American history and from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. He has studied de
Tocqueville's intellectual influence on later historians, a curious nineteenthcentury American millennial movement, Parisian popular mobilization during the
French Revolution of 1848, theoretical constructs of revolution, depression-era
American radical right movements, agricultural modernization in contemporary
France, and, currently, the impact of the French Revolution of 1789 on French
peasant communities. Professor Amann has written and published, in both English and French, in major professional journals, including the American Historical
Review, Journal of Modem History, International Review of Social History, Comparative Studies in History and Society, Revue d'histoire de la Deuxieme Guerre Mondiale,
European History Quarterly, and the New England Quarterly. Several of his articles
have been anthologized, some of them repeatedly. He has also authored two favorably-received scholarly books and several anthologies intended for undergraduates.
Professor Amann has successfully sought to balance his commitment to historical scholarship with an equal commitment to liberal education at the undergraduate level and conscientious participation in faculty governance. Over the years, he
developed and taught a wide range of courses, many of them far outside his specialties, and he also participated in the basic interdisciplinary course which shapes
the Honors Program. Professor Amann received the first University of MichiganDearborn teaching award in 1975 and was also the first recipient of the William B.
Stirton Distinguished Professorship. He also participated in numerous faculty

advisory and search committees.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming Peter H. Amann Professor Emeritus of History.
Memorials
No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Degrees
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Nielsen, the Regents
voted unanimously to take the following actions with respect to degrees: They approved the final degree list for the December 20, 1991, Law School Commencement; they approved the tentative doctoral degree list for the May 1992 Horace H.
Rackham School of Graduate Studies commencement; and they approved certain
specified changes to previously approved degree lists.
Refinancing of $56 Million Hospital Revenue Bonds, Series 1986B
Vice President Womack explained this proposal to refinance the outstanding
$56 million Hospital Revenue Bonds, Series 1986B, variable rate issue, because of
the opportunity to eliminate the costs associated with the letter of credit that is required as a liquidity facility. The liquidity requirement would instead be provided
through the use of the Hospitals' cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities.
In response to questions from Regent Nielsen, Vice President Womack emphasized that the $56 million in liquid assets would not be a set-aside; that amount
would always be available reardless of the circumstances. Mr. Herbert pointed
out that at any one time the University always has from $200 million to $250 million in liquid assets available as part o a University-wide pool.
Regent Baker pointed out that $5  on would be saved over the life of the
bond under this proposal. Vice President Womack reported that the issuing costs
would be recovered m about two years.
There being no farther discussion, Regent Brown moved that the Regents
adopt a resolution which authorizes the vice president and chief financial officer
to:
1)  together with the Underwriters, develop the terms and legal documentation for the bonds, and to prepare, circulate and execute preliminary and final official statements describing the bonds, the
University, the Hospital, and its affairs; and
2)  to apply for and obtain from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Corporation their ratings on the bonds; and
3)  to obtain a final proposal for the Bonds, including price and initial
interest rate, negotiate, execute and deliver the bond purchase and
remarketing agreement with the underwriters, a trust indenture

April Meeting 1992


Proposed License Agreement between the University of Michigan and MetaComputer
Regent Power moved, Regent Varner seconded, and all seven Regents present unanimously approved, a license agreement between the University of Michigan
and MetaComputer, Inc., to develop and commercialize a computer software program,
"AV Tracker." Because the owner of MetaComputer, Peter Wurman, is also a University employee, this arrangement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the Regents of the University of
Michigan and MetaComputer, Inc., a corporation owned by Peter
Wurman.
2.  Terms of the contract include: an effective duration of the term of
the University's copyright in the program, and consideration to the
University consisting of payment of royalties, including minimum
royalties, on licenses of the program to end users and to
sublicensee developers. Royalties wil be paid at a rate of 10 percent for revenues from the license of the program to end users and
25 percent for revenues from the license of the program to
sublicensee developers. Minimum royalties shall commence in
1993; such minimum royalties shall be $250.00 per year. The University retains ownership of the program, and royalties will be paid
to the University on revenues generated by any derivative works
developed by MetaComputer from the program. The University
retains the right to use the program internally. MetaComputer
shall make reasonable efforts to pursue the commercial development of the program. There is no use of facilities or services of the
University included in the contract and no assignment of University employees for fulfillment of the contract.
3.  Peter Wurman's pecuniary interest in the contract arises from his
ownership of MetaComputer. This corporation will receive revenues from its licensing of the program, and the University will receive a share of those revenues. Wurman's interest in that corporation will be in lieu of participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University in accordance with University policy.
Proposed Reassignment Agreements with University Employees (Walter J.
Loesche, Salam A. Syed, and Barbara E. Laughon)
Regent McFee moved, Regent Nielsen seconded, and all seven Regents present unanimously approved reassignment of the University's ownership interest in
the intellectual properties "System for Diagnosing Periodontal Disease", "Improved System for Diagnosing Periodontal Disease", and "Solid Phase Test for
the Detection of Periodontal Disease in Subgingival Plaque" to the following employee/inventors: Walter J. Loesche, Salam A. Syed, and Barbara E. Laughon.
Because the employees/inventors are University employees and will be
parties to the assignment agreement, this arrangement falls under the State of


-274 -



April Meeting 1992


Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the contract will be the University of Michigan and Drs.
Loesche, Syed, and Laughon.
2.  Terms of the contract include: standard terms in accordance with
those previously disclosed to and approved by the Regents on July
16, 1987, with the exception that the University will receive a 20
percent return (as opposed to the normal 15 percent) in recognition of the licensing efforts put forth by the University to date.
There is no use of facilities or services of the University.
3.  Drs. Loesche, Syed, and Laughon's pecuniary interest in the contract arises from their right to receive, directly from the medical
products company licensee of the technology, royalties on future
sales. Drs. Loesche, Syed, and Laughon's share of royalties from
the licensee will be in lieu of participation in the sharing of royalties received by the University in accordance with University
policy.
Proposed Research Subcontract between the University of Michigan and Henry
Ford Hospital
Regent Smith moved, Regent Power seconded, and all seven Regen Rets present
voted unanimously to approve a subcontract between the University of Michigan
and Henry Ford Hospital (HFH) for HFH's participation in clinical core activities supported by a grant to the University from the National Institutes of Health,
as described in the Regents communication. Because the principal investigators
who are parties to the subcontract, Drs. John Popovich, Jr. and Robert Hyzy, are
employees of Henry Ford Hospital and also hold clinical appointments at the
Unmversity of Michigan, this arrangement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance
with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the subcontract will be Henry Ford Hospital (HFH) and
the Regents of the University of Michigan Raymond F. Jones, administrative director for research, wil sign the subcontract for
Henry Ford Hospital.
2.  The subcontract will obligate HFH to participate in the clinical
core activities. Specifically, HFH will support the needs of the individual research projects to obtain patient samples and clinical
data and assist in the data compilation and analysis. A total subcontract of $854,490 is planned over the five-year period. The proposed scope of work and budget are described in the subcontract.
3.  Neither Dr. Popovich nor Dr. Hyzy will receive a salary or other
pecuniary benefit from the University. Their Clinical Track I
appointments at the University are without effort, without salary,
and do not allow them to see patients at the University under any


-275 -



April Meeting 1992


circumstances. The portion of their salaries related to the grant
activities will be reimbursed by HFH under the subcontract.
Revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 3.07 (Approval and Execution of University
Documents)
Vice President Womack submitted a proposal to change in Regents' Bylaw
Section 3.07 to designate specifically certain officers of the institution to transact
certain business, provides for the University to execute named documents, and
provides that delegation by the vice president and chief financial officer shall be
in writing to eliminate any question of the grant of authority to a particular individual. He noted that Mr. John Ketelhut, of the general counsel's office, had
drafted the bylaw revision. Vice President Womack also pointed out that no new
positions would be added as a result of the bylaw changes; they simply recognize
and reflect the University's current business practices.
In the discussion that followed, Mr. Ketelhut pointed out that new language
in paragraph.a. was written to facilitate real estate transactions involving estates
in other states. Regent Baker stated that he was troubled that the proposed
bylaw changes separate the Regents from the decision-making process, in that
transactions can take place without the Regents' knowledge until after the fact.
Mr. Herbebrt responded that the benefit of the change would be that it enables the executor to deliver to a purchaser without the property being titled to
the Regents, which is a benefit to the University in several respects, including
avoiding possible involvement with questions of hazardous waste contamination,
which Regent Baker had pointed out.
Further discussion followed about the details of the proposed bylaw change.
In response to a comment from Regent Baker about the reporting mechanism,
Vice President Womack stated that all transactions occurring under the bylaw
provision would be highlighted in reporting to the Regents.
Following a five-minute recess, Regent Nielsen said he would support the
bylaw change, but asked that the Regents receive a separate report monthly highlighting the transactions that occur. Following further discussion, it was decided
that the transactions would be reported on and highlighted monthly in a manner
determined to be most instructive by the development and investment staffs.
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved a revision of Regents' Bylaw Section 3.07. The following
is the text of the revised bylaw:
Sec. 3.07: Approval and Execution of University Documents
1.  All transactions involving the purchase, sale, or other disposition of
real property shall be first approved and authorized by the Board.
Unless othenvrwise specifically provided by the Board all land contracts
and deeds conveying University property shall be executed by the president and the vice president and chief financial officer.

Revision of Regents' Bylaws Sections 2.09, 7.03, 7.04, 7.05, 11.219 (Office of the
Vice President for Student Affairs)
Vice President Kennedy noted that this revision would change all mention in
the bylaws of the position of vice president for student services to vice president
for student affairs. Vice President Hartford observed t   this would make the
University's title for this position consistent with that of its peer institutions.
On a motion by Regent Brown, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
unanimously approved revisions to Regents' Bylaws Section 2.09. 7.03, 7.04, 7.05,
and 11.219. The text of the revised bylaws follows:

MAY MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, May 14, 1992
The Regents met at 1:10 P.M. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner,
and Waters. Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice Presidents Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors Jones and Wilson. Provost Whitaker and Vice President Cosovich were absent; Associate Vice
President Holbrook attended in place of Provost Whitaker.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Regent
Nielsen, who made the following motion:
Executive Session Motion
Pursuant to Sections 8(e), 8(f), and 8(h) of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, as
amended by 1984 PA 202, move that the Board ofegents meet in closed ofsession
on May 14, 1992, at 3:00 P.M. in the Regents' Room, Fleming Administration Building, for the purpose of considering material exempt from discussion or disclosure by
the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. Such exempt material consists of consulting with the Board's legal counsel in connection with specific pending litigation
[sections 8(e) and 8(h)], and the review of the contents of applications for employment, where confidentiality has been requested by the candidates [section 8(f)].
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
CESF Report - Ann Arbor Campus
President Duderstadt called on Professor Ejner Jensen, chair of the Senate
Advisory Committee on University Affairs. Professor Jensen introduced Professor Emeritus Fred Beutler, chair of the Committee on the Economic Status of
the Faculty, to present that committee's report.
Professor Beutler's presentation concentrated on three topics: an analysis of
faculty salaries, concerns about changes in health benefits, and administrative
growth. The salary analysis shows that average salaries for assistant and associate
professor ranks are higher than the average of peer institutions, while those for
full professors are lower. CESF describes this phenomenon as a "loyalty tax" on
full professors, and the group believes that it is destructive to the morale of
senior faculty and promotes their departure. They proposed that CESF and the
administration jointly undertake further analysis and study of this issue.
There are several issues of concern: in the area of health benefits: the perceived possibility that fiscal constraints might lead to changes in coverage without
CESFs having been consulted, and long-range prospects for the continuation of
medical benefits for retirees. The latter issue is of particular concern because
this is an unfunded liability with a potential total of over $200 million.


-283 -



May Meeting, 1992


The pattern of growth in University administration, as documented in the
Holbrook Report (March 1991), remains an area of concern to faculty. CESF
recommends that a public report focusing on changes in staffing in all employee
categories be issued annually so that a meaningful dialogue can be undertaken on
priorities.
In the discussion that followed, Associate Vice President Holbrook stated
that CESF would be invited to play an active role in any discussion of changes in
staff benefits. In response to a question from Regent Power, Vice President
Womack confirmed that the future liability for retiree health care benefits does
indeed represent a major financial problem for the University.
Following further discussion of this issue, the president called on Chancellor
Wilson, who introduced Professor Arefaine Yohannes, chair of CESF at UMDearborn.
CESF Report, UM-Dearborn
Professor Yohannes noted that his committee's recommendations are the
same as those of last year: to raise the average UM-D faculty salaries to the
median level of Michigan HA average salaries in the short-run and to at least the
80th percentile level in the long-run; and to provide tuition assistance to spouses
and dependents of faculty. He noted that not much progress had been made
toward achieving these goals, although the figures might be somewhat more encouraging if spring/summer salaries were included.
Regent Power noted that Chancellor Wilson does not disagree with the
salary goals, and that the major stumbling block toward achieving these goals is
in the willingness of the state legislature to fund the Dearborn campus. Professor
Yohannes concurred, noting that Chancellor Wilson had implemented some special merit increases, although these had not substantially reduced the gap.
Regent Baker noted that the Regents are limited in the actions they can take
by the funds appropriated by the legislature.
Following further comments, the president called on Chancellor Jones, who
introduced Professor Charles Johnston, CESF committee member at UM-Flint.
CESF Report, UM-Flint
Professor Johnston noted that he was substituting for the CESF chair, Professor Kenneth West, who could not be present.
Professor Johnston's report focused on four areas of concern for faculty at
UM-Flint: 1) the average salary of three tenure track ranks at UM-Flint compared to three other sets of institutions; 2) the distribution of faculty ranks, especially the percentages of nontenure track positions; 3) the use of part-time (adjunct) faculty; 4) a comparison of average faculty salaries among the several
schools and colleges at UM-Flint.
CESF figures show that salaries at UM-Flint are average compared with


-284 -



May Meeting, 1992


peers; the goal is to be at the 80th percentile. They also show that UM-Flint has
a higher percentage of nontenure track full-time and adjunct (part-time) faculty
than its peer institutions, and that CESF believes this to be a very serious problem that must be addressed by the administration.
Regent McFee pointed out that the use of adjunct faculty can be viewed in a
positive light, in that part-time faculty allow the tniversity to make use of community members with specific areas of expertise and thereby enhance the course
opportunities available to students. Chancellor Jones observed that some of the
reliance on part- time faculty is a result of the significant enrollment growth that
occurred during the 1980s. He also said that part-time faculty are very valuable
in the Schools of Management and Health Sciences, although they are a concern
in the College of Arts and Sciences. He noted that some of the lack of tenure opportunities can be attributed to demographic factors, whereby large numbers of
faculty have been reaching retirement age over the past few years.
Following further discussion, the president turned to the regular business
agenda.
Minutes
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously approved the minutes of the meeting of April 16, 1992.
Reports
Vice President Womack submitted reports on Investment Transactions, Endowment Fund Quarterly Inventory, Plant Extension, Litigation, and
Personnel-Labor Relations. He and Mr. Herbert also responded to questions
from Regent Baker about the University's investment in Olympia & York. Vice
President Womack assured the Regents that the University is prepared to take
the necessary actions to protect the asset if that were indicated.
Vice President Kelly submitted Reports of Projects Established, Research
and Other Activities, and Summaries of a Selection of Current Research.
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
voted unanimously to receive the reports.
Six-Month Report on University Audits
Mr. Carl Smith, director of University Audits, submitted the regular
six-month report on university audits. Regent Nielsen complimented him on the
very complete report.
Expenditure of the Income of the Julian A. Wolfson and the Marguerite Wolfson
Endowment Funds for the Fiscal Year 1992-93
Regent Smith moved, and Regent Brown seconded, approval of the uses of
the income of the Wolfson Endowment Funds as recommended by the Law Faculty and detailed in the Regents communication. Regent Power requested that


-285 -



May Meeting, 1992


the Regents receive a report indicating the pattern of expenditures from this fund
over the past three years, and Regent Baker requested information about the
corpus of the fund. Following some discussion, the vote was taken, and the
motion was approved unanimously.
Sale of $56,000,000 Adjustable Rate Demand Hospital Revenue Refunding
Bonds, Series 1992A
Vice President Womack informed the Regents that the Adjustable Rate Demand Hospital Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 1992A, were sold on May 13,
1992, and were remarketed at an initial rate of 32 percent. The bond issuance
costs will be recovered in one year, yielding a savings of about $184,000 per year
thereafter.
Vice President Womack read the following opinion from Moody's Municipal
Credit Report of May 12, 1992 into the record:
Strong regional draw provided by the breadth and quality of services has
resulted in steady improving utilization. The presence of the University
and its well respected Medical School further enhances the long-term
credit strength by providing a constant flow of a well qualified medical
staff. These factors are supported by excellent financial performance
which is enhanced by an outstanding liquidity position and a
state-of-the- art facility. The VMIG 1 rating reflects the University of
Michigan Hospitals' own short-term credit quality. Factors contributing
to this high quality include a sizable cash position and the liquidity of
the investment portfolio, as well as strong internal investment
management.
Financing of Major Capital Projects
Vice President Womack noted that the Regents had been apprised of several
major capital projects that were of critical importance to the University. State
capital outlay funding had been approved for the first two of these projects, but
there is little likelihood of any funds being appropriated in the near future. Vice
President Womack said that he had concluded that the combination of both low
interest rates and a competitive construction bidding climate provide an
opportunity for the University to proceed with these critically needed projects,
which have a combined total cost of $62.5 million. He stated that all or part of
the costs of the projects would be financed by the issuance of tax exempt bonds,
most likely but not necessarily, at fixed rate terms secured by a pledge of student
fees, and amortized over a period of up to 30 years.
The projects, as described in the Regents communication, include renovation
of the East Engineering Building to provide consolidated quarters for the
Departments of Mathematics and Psychology ($27.5 million); an addition to
Randall Laboratory for the Physics Department ($21.4 million); an addition to
the Undergraduate Library ($6.85 million); and capital support for additional
administrative office space ($6.5 million).


-286 -



May Meeting, 992


Following Vice President Womack's description of the projects, Regent
Power moved that the Regents approve the University's financing all the projects
as described, approve development of plans for the additions to the Undergraduate Library, authorize completion of contract documents for the East Engineering renovation and the Randall Laboratory addition, authorize the provision of
resources for support of administrative offices, and authorize the appointment of
Albert Kahn and Associates as architect for the library. Regent Waters seconded
the motion.
Regent Baker observed that in the past, most major building and maintenance projects had been paid for by the state; obligating student fees for this type
of undertaking would be a long-term obligation, and would represent a major
turning point Tuition increases and facuty salaries would be on the agenda in
upcoming months, and Regent Baker calculated that the cost for the proposed
projects, at 33,000 students, would equal about $2,300. Regent Baker noted that
he had consistently objected to the use of student fees as pledges for any use
other than those directly related to students, and expressed concern about how
this would affect the cost of education over the life of the bonds.
President Duderstadt responded that with the exception of three major
projects in which the state had funded a portion of the costs, all other construction on campus over the past 20 years had been financed by University sources,
including student fees. This is the sixth year of a freeze on state capital outlay
funding, and funding will likely not be resumed in the near future. The University's own calculation is that the cost of the debt service for these projects will be
approximately $5 million per year, which equals about $130-$140 per student.
One hundred dollars of that amount was put in place with the $50 per term infrastructure fee that was instituted in 1991. The president stated his opinion that an
assessment for improvements in academic facilities should be a far higher priority
than paying for athletic facilities.
Regent Nielsen opined that state funding for capital facilities is unlikely to
happen in this century; thus decisions had to be made. He also questioned
Regent Baker's figures, noting that the facilities would be funded over 30 years
and used over a half century; they would therefore be used by possibly 500,000
students during that time. He also pointed out that construction costs would not
decline, and mentioned the negative effect there might be on retention and recruitment of faculty if the projects are not undertaken. Thus he concluded that
the Regents should go ahead with the projects.
Regent Power pointed out that the proposed action is prudent financially, as
interest rates and construction costs were favorable at the current time. Regent
Power said that the other issue had to do with debt service coverage, and asked
Vice President Womack to address that issue.
Vice President Womack explained that a pledge of student fees refers to
more than tuition; the only thing that cannot be pledged is the state appropriation. What one pledges and what is used to pay the debt service is not the same.
Fees are pledged because that is a continuing stream of income which the Regents have control over, and results in a better rating. But all unrestricted funds


-287 -



May Meeting, 199


are commingled and, with the exception of the state appropriation, all funds are
available to pay this debt.
Regent Power pointed out that the University's debt obligation as a function
of streams of income available to service the debt ranks relatively low among universities nationally. Mr. Herbert reported that the University's student fee coverage is 20 times the average debt service. Regent Power concluded that since the
state appeared to be unable to support the University's capital needs, it was a
question of whether the Regents ought to manage the Umversity so as to optimize it as a resource for students and for the state, and he concluded that they
should.
Regent McFee supported this observation, noting that she had considered
whether the Regents should "take the state off the hook" by proceeding with the
funding for capital projects using its own resources. But she recognized that the
state was not going to be in a position to obtain the resources in time to preserve
these assets, so that it was important to protect the institution in the best possible
way it has available to it.
Regent Smith asked how the cost of the debt at $140 per student would
impact tuition, noting that she would like to have this information before voting
on the issue.
President Duderstadt responded that the $50 per term infrastructure fee,
which generates slightly more than $3.2 million per year, is already covered. The
remainder will have to be covered by the fees already in place, and would have to
be weighed against other needs of the institution, including salary programs and
benefits. The administration was not yet prepared to make a tuition recommendation, partly because it does not know yet what the budget situation will be next
year. He sensed that the additional funds necessary for the debt service (approximately $2 million) would probably come off the top of whatever tuition is recommended, rather than driving it up.
Regent Smith responded that this still did not answer her question; Vice
President Holbrook, the chief budget officer, stated that the president's comments were accurate, also noting that indirect cost rates, state appropriation, and
enrollment figures for next year would all impact the tuition recommendations.
President Duderstadt pointed out that this debt service would not be a major
factor in determining the tuition recommendation, as most of the revenue stream
for it is already in place.
Regent Smith observed that with so many uncertainties, she felt it would be
more prudent to wait on this issue, and that she would abstain from voting until
she had more information about what the tuition recommendations would be.
Regent Baker asked why the $62.5 million for capital construction could not
be included in the upcoming Capital Campaign. President Duderstadt responded
that historically, campaigns have had considerable difficulty raising money for facilities, as opposed to people. He also pointed out that there is considerable risk
in embarking on a major campaign, as illustrated by the difficulty the University


-288 -



May Meeting, 1992


experienced in raising funds for the Chemical Sciences Building in an earlier
campaign, in which not enough funds were raised. For the upcoming campaign,
the number of facilities for which funding is being sought has been minimized,
and even those will be very problematic until sufficient major gifts have been
secured to allow proceeding.
Regent Brown pointed out that money received for endowment from the
Capital Campaign will produce income that will help offset some other general
fund requirements. In response to a question from Regent Baker, it was
explained that even though student fees are pledged for the debt service, what is
actually used are unrestricted funds from all sources. There reswould not be an
incremental $130-$140 debt service fee included as part of the tuition assessment;
this amount would be covered in the whole magnitude of the General Fund
budget The $5 million annual debt service would be one of the budget items
included in the General Fund budget.
Following further discussion, Regent Smith noted that she was still unclear
about how tuition would be affected by this. Regent Brown observed that these
facilities have been needed for a long time, the University was now in a position
financially to assume these costs, and students, faculty, and citizens of Michigan
need them.
The vote was then taken on Regent Power's motion to approve funding for
all projects as described in the Regents communication (see above), and it
carried, with Regents Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Varner, and Waters in
favor, Regent Baker opposed, and Regent Smith abstaining.
Venture Capital Investment
Vice President Womack presented a recommendation for commitment of $1
million of the University Endowment to Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers VI,
LP. Following some discussion, Regent Nielsen moved that $1 million of the
University Endowment Fund be committed to Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers
VI, L.P. Regent Brown seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
The meeting then recessed, at 3:00 P.M., to meet in executive session.
Friday, May 15, 1992
The Regents met at 9:00 A.M. in the Regents Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner, and
Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as were Chancellors
Jones and Wilson. Vice President Cosovich was absent; Regent Varner arrived
shortly after the start of the meeting.
Olympia & York Investment
Regent Smith observed that Olympia & York had filed for bankruptcy. She


-289 -



May Meeting, 1992


offered a resolution that Vice President Womack take whatever steps he deems
necessary to protect the interests of the University. Regent Baker seconded the
motion.
Vice President Womack noted that the three properties securing the University's O&Y investment were not involved in the bankruptcy proceedindgs, which at
ths point involve the company's corporate interests, and not their US real estate
interests Because the properties collateralizing the notes generate income
greater than the amount required to service the debt, it would be in O&Y's best
interest to continue to hold those properties. He reiterated that his staff is
maintaining a constant vigil over the situation.
Regent Baker stated that he has every confidence in Vice President Womack
and hisstaff, and hi  that this resolution gives them full authority to do what is
necessary without first seeking approval from the Regents.
Following some further discussion, the vote was taken, and the resolution
was approved unanimously.
Voluntariy Support
President Duderstadt presented the report of voluntary support for the
month of April 1992 in the absence of Vice President Cosovich. He noted that
contributions were down from last year, due to the maturation of bequests, which
are subject to fluctuation. On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent
McFee, the Regents received the following gifts, ith thanks, and in accord with

David M. French Professor. The Regents approved the appointment of Eugene
H. Studier as the David M. French Professor at the University of Michigan-Flint, for a
period of two years, effective July 1, 1992.
Recommended promotions to ranks of professor, associate professor, and assistant
professor. Provost Whitaker described the promotion and tenure review process,
noting that it is very extensive and involves both internal and external review. He
commented that an outstanding group of people was being recommended for promotion.
In response to a question from Regent Power, Provost Whitaker observed that the
rate of review of the eligible pool for women and minorities was lower than the rate
for all of the candidates. However, this is because many of the women and minorities
in the review pool were hired within the past three to four years, so they are not really
at the review point. He expressed confidence that the numbers of women and minonties eligible and ready for review will improve in upcoming years.
Provost Whitaker also responded to questions about the retention rate for women
and minorities and the implications of an increasing number of senior faculty retirements.
Following some discussion, Chancellors Wilson and Jones presented faculty promotions from their respective campuses. Then, there being no further questions,
Regent Varner moved, Regent Nielsen seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, the recommended promotions to ranks of professor, associate professor, and
assistant professor for all three campuses.

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Nielsen, the Regents
voted unanimously to adopt the following retirement memoirs:
Leslie R Bassett, Albert A. Stanley Distinguished University Professor of
Music (Composition), will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1992.
What could be said were the skeleton to retire from the body? Composition
is the backbone of the art of music; and Leslie Bassett, true composer, himself
possessed of ample backbone and impeccable character, for 40 years has given
critical skeletal support to artistry in the School of Music and far beyond.
Professor Bassett was born in Hanford, California, in 1923. During World
War II, he served as a musician with the 13th Armored Division Band in France
and Germany. He received his BA degree in 1947 from California State University at Fresno, and he completed his M.Mus. and Ph.D. degrees, in 1949 and
1956, respectively, at the University of Michigan, where his principal mentor was
Ross Lee Finney; As recipient of a Fulbright grant, he continued his studies with
Arthur Honegger and Nadia Boulanger in Paris, and subsequently worked with
Roberto Gerhard and Mario Davidovsky. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1952 as an instructor of music (composition); he was promoted to assistant professor in 1956, associate professor in 1960, and professor in 1965.

May Meeting, 1992


Having experienced many performances of his works, and having received
numerous awards, prizes, and commissions, Professor Bassett has been much
honored. His hundred-plus compositions are internationally known, having been
performed or recorded by such stellar ensembles as the RAI Symphony Orchestra of Rome, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Radio Zurich Orchestra, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, and the Juilliard Quartet. He received the Pulitzer
Prize in 1966, and has also been awarded the prestigious Prix de Rome,
Koussevitsky and Guggenheim fellowships, National Endowment for the Arts
commissions, and membership in the American Academy and Institute of Arts
and Letters. At the University of Michigan, Professor Bassett's honors include
his appointments as the Albert A. Stanley Distinguished University Professor
(since 1977) and the Hemy Russel Lecturer (1984).
The Regents now salute this distinguished musician by naming Leslie R.
Bassett the Albert A. Stanley Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Music.
Joachim Bruhn, professor of German and humanities at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active faculty status on April 30, 1992.
A native of Germany, Professor Bruhn received his doctorate from the University of Kiel, Germany, in 1953, and also studied at the University of Zurich,
Oxford University, and at Brown University. Before coming to the University of
Michigan-Dearborn in 1974, he taught at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor,
Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and Richmond College of CUNY.
Professor Bruhn served as dean of the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters
at UM-Dearborn from 1974-79 and as director of the Honors Program from
1979-83. He was also instrumental in the creation of the highly successful International Studies Program, serving as director from 1981-84.
As professor of German, Professor Bruhn taught a wide range of courses in
literature and culture. A dynamic and enthusiastic teacher, he had great success
in attracting and keeping students in the German program. For many years, he
was very active in teaching East German literature, at a time when the subject
was often neglected. He maintained active contact with area high schools and
visited classes to inform students and teachers about the foreign language programs at UM-Dearborn. His yearly travels to East and West Germany kept his
teaching informed by direct and up-to-date experience of current events and
trends in the two Germanies; many UM-Dearbomrn students traveled to Germany
to participate in the work and study programs he organized.
Professor Bruhn was also very concerned with developing students' cultural
lives, and regularly organized groups of students and their families to attend Detroit Symphony Orchestra concerts. He made these cultural opportunities a hallmark of the Honors Program during his directorship.
The Regents now salute this veteran teacher and administrator for his service
to the University by naming Joachim Bruhn Professor Emeritus of German and
Humanities.
C. Merle Crawford, professor of marketing in the School of Business Administration, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 1992.

May Meetin    1992


faculty as associate professor of marketing in 1965 and was promoted to
professor in 1967.
Professor Crawford's corporate experience was invaluable in his academic
career, where he concentrated on course development and research in the social
responsibilities of business, new product development strategies, and managing
new product concept generation processes in organizations. As one of the early
members of the marketing faculty, Professor Crawford has been instrumental in
curricular development and in retaining and mentoring promising junior faculty
members to make this one of the pre-eminent marketing departments in the
country. As an example of his strong reputation, he was named marketing educator of the year i 1974.
As an excellent citizen of the school, a valued teacher and researcher, and a
leader in the development and growth of the marketing department, Professor
Crawford will be missed by the faculty and staff of the School of Business Administration, who wish him well in his retirement
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming C. Merle Crawford
Professor Emeritus of Marketing.

duties included several years as chair of the accounting discipline and as a
member of the School of Management's executive committee. He also served on,
and chaired, the Business Operations Advisory Committee, the Academic Affairs
Advisory Committee, and many other unit and campus committees.
Professor Culp's career has been characterized by a diversity of interests in
the teaching and practice of accounting, and in the development of accounting
standards. His teaching has included all levels offered in the school, from principles to graduate courses. He introduced not-for-profit accounting to the curriculum nine years ago and taught it until his retirement. Students found his courses
to be both challenging and rewarding, as letters from graduates testify. Professor
Culp was also active in the accounting profession through participation in numerous professional organizations, including the American Accounting Association,
the Institute of Management Accountants, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. His interest in the continuing development of accounting standards found outlet in such activities as editing a column for The Michigan
CPA, presenting continuing education seminars, and submitting critiques of proposed accounting standards. In recognition of his career achievements, Professor
Culp was named the Ernst & Whinney Professor of Management Accounting for
1985-89, the first named professorship in the history of the School of Management.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming
William H. Culp Professor Emeritus of Business Administration.

Memorial Statements
No deaths were reported to the Regents this month.
Special Liquor Licenses
Vice President Womack explained that there are rare occasions on which the
University needs to apply to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission for a special liquor license. The commission has recently changed its application procedure for these one-event licenses, and the University's general counsel has devised a method that will comply with the state's requirements without having to
seek regental approval separately for all future applications.
Mr. John Ketelhut, of the General Counsel's office, responded to questions
from the Regents about the application procedure and the need for special liquor
licenses. Regent Baker stated that given the large numbers of under-age students
at the University, he would like there to be a reference in the resolution that the
licenses are for adult consumption only. Mr. Ketelhut responded that the law requires that licensees will serve neither minors nor people who are visibly intoxicated.


-310 -



May Meeting 1992


Dr. Zuidema, who chaired the task.force on alcohol and illegal substances,
stated that University policy is that the laws will be observed in every instance.
Regent Baker requested that the minutes refer to this policy.
Following further discussion, Regent Baker moved, subject to adherence to
University policy and Regental intent with respect to upholding state law, that
the Regents authorize the vice president and chief financial officer or the vice
president's written designee to apply to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission for the issuance of special liquor licenses to the University for the sale of
beer and wine or beer, wine, and spirits for consumption at specified University
events as they are considered necessary. Regent McFee seconded the motion,
and it was approved unanimously.
UM-Flint Frances Willson Thompson Library and Central Energy Plant/Utility
Distribution System
Chancellor Jones gave a historical overview of plans for the Flint campus library, noting that it had been conceived 14 years ago. Efforts at private
fundraising began in the early 1980s, and at the current time, over $18 million towards construction of the new library has been raised. Expansion of the central
energy plant is also necessary to service the new library, and the state has made it
clear that power plants will no longer be considered for state funding. Construction financing must be secured through student fees; however, this project is such
a critical need on the Flint campus that Chancellor Jones believes most students
would endorse this type of financing.
Vice President Womack described all of the aspects of the proposal, noting
that the exact amount of financing is as yet undetermined.
Regent Nielsen moved the approval of the UM-Flint Frances Willson
Thompson Library and central energy plant/utility distribution system, as described in the Regents communication. He observed that this project is long
overdue and desperately needed, and that the facility will serve the Flint
community as well as the campus.
Regent Baker seconded the motion, and noted the remarkable progress that
has been made on the Flint campus in the 15 years that it has been in existence.
Regent Power expressed his support for the project, and pointed out that the
field of library science is undergoing a tremendous revolution. He requested that
the architects be required to consult extensively with specialists in this field as
they design the project, noting the design should anticipate changes in this rapidly
evolving field. He asked that when the design is brought back to the Regents, a
specific portion of that report address how the design will accommodate the
changes occurring in the field of library science.
Vice President Womack clarified that the maximum total indebtedness for
the project during the time that pledges are maturing would be $7 million, including $3.5 million for the central energy plant.


-311 -



May Meeting, 1992


There being no further discussion, the vote was taken, and the Regents unanimously approved the following: the revised project budget for the library; soliciting bids and awarding a construction contract to the successful bidder, providing
the contract value is within the approved budget; expansion of the central energy
plant utility distribution system and authoriztion of the appointment of Harley
Ellington Pierce Yee Associates, Inc. as the architects-engineers; and financing a
portion of both projects' construction cash flow through the issuance of tax
exempt debt.
Art and Architecture - Outdoor Work Pavilion
Vice President Womack called on Mr. Fred Mayer, university planner, to describe a shelter that is to be constructed on the south side of the Art and Architecture Building. Mr. Mayer displayed a model of the proposed structure, which
was designed by and is to be constructed by architecture graduate students. The
project will be funded largely with donations, and will be completed by the fall of
1992.
University of Michigan Hospitals Certificate of Need for the Hospitals' Computer Hardware Upgrades
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents

computer system to a IBM ES 9000 Model 820, at a total cost of $13 million.
University of Michigan Hospitals Amendment to the Certificate of Need for the
Implementation of Patient Management, Patient Accounting, and Medical
Records
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Varner, the Regents
unanimously approved amending the Certificate of Need for the implementation
of patient management, patient accounting, and medical records, increasing the
budget from $4.5 million to $7 million.
University of Michigan Hospitals Certificate of Need for Ambulatory Surgery

Vice Provost Zuidema explained that growth in the demand for ambulatory
surgery services has exceeded the capacity of the operating rooms at University
of Michigan Hospitals, which were built with a primary focus on inpatients. The
combined growth of inpatient and outpatient surgery has also increased the demands on the existing surgical facilities.
The University of Michigan Hospitals Executive Board is proposing to relieve the over-utilized adult operating room suite by building a six-operatingroom, two-procedure-room ambulatory surgery center off-site at a location m
close proximity to the Medical Campus.
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Smith, the Regents
unanimously approved submission of a Certificate of Need to the Michigan


-312 -



May Meeting, 1992


Department of Public Health to build a freestanding off-site ambulatory surgery
center.
Cancer and Geriatrics Center Project
Vice President Womack reported that this is a request for a change in the
scope of the originally approved project to include completion of a portion of the
research space that had been slated to be left unfinished, and to redesign administration and faculty office components to be clinical program space. These
revisions will necessitate an amendment to the Certificate of Need application.
Regent Baker complimented everyone involved in this project for cooperating in conceiving this magnificent building on a prime site on the Medical
Campus.
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Waters, the Regents
unanimously approved revisions in the scope of the Cancer and Geriatrics Center
Project, as described in the Regents communication, and submission of an
amendment to the Certificate of Need.
Medical Center North Entrance Parking Structure
Vice President Womack called on Mr. Douglas Hanna, assistant director of
capital programs to give a presentation on the design of the Medical Center
North Entrance Parking Structure.
Mr. Hanna announced that the Certificate of Need applications for both the
Cancer and Geriatrics Center and the North Entrance Parking Structure had recently been approved. He displayed site maps and drawings of the interior of the
six-floor structure, along with renderings of the Cancer and Geriatrics Center,
parking structure and parking structure office building on the site, and responded
to questions from the Regents about various features of the design. He also displayed a model of the entire complex, which illustrates the transition from the
parking structure to the Cancer and Geriatrics facility and how it fits in with the
surrounding buildings.
Regent Power observed that the design does not include a place for cars to
turn around in if they miss the entrance to the parking structure, and requested
that this issue be addressed before the plans are finalized.
Following additional discussion, Regent Power moved approval of the design
of the North Entrance Parking Structure as presented. Regent Nielsen seconded
the motion, and it was adopted unanimously.
University of Michigan Hospitals Parking Structure Office Building Project
On a motion by Regent Nielsen, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the Parking Structure Office Building project, to be located atop the North Entrance Parking Structure. They also approved commissioning of TMP Associates, Inc., in association with Hansen Lind Mayer as the


-313 -



May Meeting, 1992


architect, and authorized submission of an application for a Certificate of Need
with the Michigan Department of Public Health.
Renovations
Vice President Womack presented several proposed renovation projects.
Professor John Cross, associate dean of the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts, was present and responded to questions about renovations in the Frieze
Building.
Following some discussion, Regent Baker moved, Regent Varner seconded,
and the Regents unanimously approved, the following renovation projects: 1)
renovation within University Hospital to create an operating room pharmacy; 2)
laboratory remodeling within the C.C. Little Building for the geological sciences
department; 3) renovations within the H.S. Frieze Building for the communications department; and 4) replacement of Hubbard Road recreation fields by enlarging an existing field adjacent to the Bursley parking lot and adding three new
fields adjacent to the existing Fuller Mitchell fields.
Reassignment of Ownership Interest in Intellectual Property (Jess G. Thoene,
M.D.)
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Varer, all seven Regents present unanimously approved reassignment of the University's ownership
interest in the intellectual property "Method of Treating HIV Infection to its employee/inventor, Jess G. Thoene, M.D. Because Dr. Thoene is an employee of
the University who will also be a party to the assignment agreement, this arrangement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.  Parties to the assignment agreement will be the University of
Michigan and Jess G. Thoene, M.D.
2.  The terms and pecuniary interests were previously disclosed to and
approved by the Regents on July 16, 1987, and are hereby
incorporated by reference in this Regental action.
Academic Calendar Revision for University of Michigan-Flint
Regent Varner moved, Regent McFee seconded, and the Regents
unanimously approved revision of the fall 1992 and fall 1993 academic calendars,
changing the dates for commencement to December 17, 1992, and December 19,
1993, respectively.
Statement from Regent Baker about Alumni Association and Regental Candidates
Regent Baker announced that he wanted to put a motion on the table. He
explained that it involves Regent Brown, and as he had not yet had a chance to
discuss it with him and he hadn't known he was not going to be here today, he
would not seek action on the motion.


-314 -



May Meeting, 1992


"One of Michigan's traditions is that the University and its Alumni Association by and large do not involve themselves in the elections of members of the
Board of Regents. The proper method of electing regents is clearly stated in the
Constitution of the State of Michigan, wherein nomination of such candidates is
left to the respective political party. While it saddens me to bring this matter forward to enter the public record, it may be necessary that a line be drawn clearly
delineating appropriate and inappropriate political involvement in regental elections by the University of Michigan Alumni Association. It seems that the Regents can be helpful in providing this insight.
It has been observed that some regents emeriti, all of whom are directors of
the Alumni Association, have established themselves as a committee to recommend candidates for the office of regent for the Republican Party. The committee has recruited two candidates, one male and one female, to run against two
Republican office holders, Regent Veronica Smith and Regent Neal Nielsen, in
1992. Further, these candidates have been interviewed by Mr. Forman, the president of the Alumni Association. In addition, at least one of these candidates has
been presented to officials of Governor Engler's administration as candidates satisfactory to the committee.
It is unclear what the actual involvement of the Alumni Association is in this
matter, but on the surface it appears an effort to unseat both Regents Nielsen
and Smith, and it may have its roots in the Alumni Association. Therefore, I
move that Regent Paul Brown and Regent Deane Baker be named as a committee of two by the Regents and be authorized to review and discuss this matter
with Mr. Forman, directors of the Alumni Association, and others who might provide insight into the genesis of the committee and its purposes. The comrmttee
would then report its findings of the committee to the Board of Regents.
Regent Baker indicated he would leave the motion on the table for either
action or up and down at the next meeting.
The president then turned to the final action items.
Vacant Land, South Main Street, Ann Arbor
On a motion by Regent Power, seconded by Regent Baker, the Regents
unanimously approved the purchase of approximately 12.5 acres of land on South
Main Street at a price of $450,000, as described in the Regents communication.
Regent Baker requested a copy of the letter of support from Johnson, Johnson,
and Roy/inc.
Comments by Regent Nielsen
Regent Nielsen stated that he was somewhat surprised by Regent Baker's
comments about the Alumni Association, noting that he was not sure that everything in his statement was true and accurate.
Comments by Regent Power
Regent Power observed that the Regents had approved an extensive set of
renovations for the central campus and major new construction projects on the


-315 -



May Meeting 1992


medical campus. As the flagship institution of the state, the University of Michigan bears proportionately greater risk in exposure to the state's financial and political stresses than other educational institutions. By the board's actions, it was
reaffirming its duty to see that the University is well-managed and that it serve
the state's citizens by making the facilities improvements necessary to provide
education, research, and healing to people in the state. He added that it would
be preferable to have support from the state, and it is hoped that this will one day
be possible.
The president expressed agreement with this sentiment.
Regents' Meeting Schedule for 1993
On a motion by Regent Varner, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the following schedule of meetings for calendar year 1993:
January 21-22                     July 15-16

$432.42.

JUNE MEETING, 1992


The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
Thursday, June 11, 1992
The Regents met at 1:00 P.M. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Duderstadt and Regents Baker, Brown, McFee, Nielsen, Power, Smith, Varner,
and Waters. Provost Whitaker, Vice President and Secretary Kennedy, and Vice
Presidents Cosovich, Hartford, Kelly, and Womack were also present, as was
Chancellor Jones. Chancellor Wilson was absent; Provost Simpson attended in
her place.
President Duderstadt called the meeting to order and called on Regent
Nielsen, who made the following motion:
Executive Session Motion
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, as amended by
1984 PA 202, I move that the Board of Regents meet in closed session in the Regents' Room on June 11, 1992, immediately following completion of the business
portion of the Regents' Meeting for the purpose of considering material exempt from
discussion or disclosure by the Michigan Freedom of Information Act. Such exempt
material consists of consulting with the Board's attorney regarding trial or settlement
strategy in connection with specific pending litigation
Regent Power seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Proposed 1992-93 UM Hospitals Operating Budget
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Womack, who introduced Mr.
John Forsyth, executive director of University of Michigan Hospitals, to present
the proposed 1992-93 UM Hospitals Operating Budget.
Mr. Forsyth observed that the major challenge in preparing the operating
budget was to balance academic needs and health care financial realities. He
outlined the Hospitals' historical responses to the changing environment since
1984, describing a number of significant actions the Hospitals had taken during
that time. He enumerated the challenges he had identified in the 1991-92
budget, and described what had been done to meet each one. The challenges
identified include continuing existing levels of academic support; continuing to
focus growth and maximize use of fixed resources; maintaining high quality staff
with a competitive compensation program; continuing to fund depreciation; improving the payer mix; improving competitive position; and breaking-even on operations in FY 1992. He noted that the cost per case in FY 1992 had been reduced significantly under the budgeted amount.
Mr. Forsyth pointed out that in 1992, the return on operations was 5.6 percent, with a 10.4 percent return on total margin; these are the best returns since
1985. From a historical perspective, prior to 1979, operating margins either did
not exist, or were negative.


-317 -



June Meeting, 1992


The 1992-93 budget is a "no-growth" budget. With regard to cost, the objec
tives are to continue cost effectiveness program reductions; enhance academic
support; increase admissions and clinic visits/decrease length of stay; self-fund a
competitive salary program; and maintain the emphasis on cost per case. Room
rates will be reduced (for routine room rates) or maintained (intensive care).
The results will be to maintain the high quality of staff and patient care, improve
the Hospitals' competitive position, and enhance its financial strength.
Mr. Forsyth displayed graphs and tables illustrating the exact figures that will
be used to achieve these goals. He concluded his presentation by re questing that
the Regents approve the proposed FY 1993 operating budget as described.
Following some discussion, Regent Baker moved approval of the proposed
1992-93 UM Hospitals operating budget, including a reduction in the private/semi- private room rate of 20.6 percent and no change in the intensive care
unit room rate. Regent Nielsen seconded the motion, and it was approved unani
mously.
Historical Overview of M-Care, Inc.
Vice President Womack introduced Mr. Peter Roberts, president of M-Care,
Inc., to present a historical overview of M-Care.
Mr. Roberts reported that M-Care had developed into a very successful
health maintenance organization, and gave a slide presentation describing the locations of its service area, providers, and membership. He noted that membership had grown from 5,107 in 1986, its first year of operation, to 40,905 in 1992,
and that the organization had achieved an operating break-even position in 1989
and a positive fund balance in 1991. The M-Care strategic plan for 1992-94 calls
for enhancement and strengthening of existing operating systems, diversification
into new market segments, and increased support for the teaching and health service research activities of the University.
President Duderstadt and Regent Power commented on the outstanding
leadership and impressive performance of M-Care.
Michigan Student Assembly Financial Matters
The president called on Vice President Hartford to present a report on financial matters related to Michigan Student Assembly.
Report on Current Fiscal Year. Vice President Hartford called on Mr.
Rodger Wolf, assistant to the vice president for student affairs, to present the
report. Mr. Wolf said that this report was one of the best that had been submitted in recent years. The audited financial statements indicate an excellent fund
balance, good financial position, improved controls, and a better management
letter than had been seen in the past.
In response to a question from Regent Nielsen about how this budget compares to other student government budgets around the country, Mr. Wolf stated
that a survey of peer institutions was planned for the coming year. Regent


-318 -



June Meeting, 1992


Nielsen indicated that the cash balance appeared to be larger than necessary; Mr.
Wolf reported that on August 31, 1992, the balance estimate will be about
$70,000. Mr. Wolf indicated that the auditors recommend that there be a cash
reserve for working capital purposes of $40,000-$50,000. The additional reserves
could be used for various program purposes.
Regent Nielsen observed that the fact that the cash balance is so high might
be an indication that the student fee assessment is too high. Further conversation
ensued on that topic, with Mr. Wolf and Vice President Hartford indicating that
any extra reserves could be used for additional programming, student organization funding, and funding for depredation on equipment.
Mr. Wolf reported that in response to a regental mandate, Michigan Student
Assembly had hired a full-time bookkeeper/financial analyst in January 1992. In
response to a question from Regent Nielsen, Mr. Wolf confirmed that a former
secretary had been indicted for misappropriating funds from Student Legal Services during the past calendar year.
Regent Baker expressed agreement with Regent Nielsen that if there were
surplus funds, the MSA fee assessment should be reduced. In response to a question from Regent Baker about the defalcation at Student Legal Services, Mr.
Wolf pointed out that at the time of last year's MSA presentation to the Regents,
nobody was aware that it had occurred. When it became known, law enforcement authorities were notified and immediate action was taken to apprehend the
former employee.
Regent Power observed that the management letter was an improvement
over the last one. He questioned the degree to which financial oversight and
scrutiny is welcomed within MSA, Student Legal Services, and the Ann Arbor
Tenants Union. Mr. Wolf responded that although the officers were cooperative,
he believed organizations did not welcome this type of oversight of their financial
affairs and would prefer that it did not occur. Mr. Carl Smith, director of University Audits, concurred that this has been the case historically.
Vice President Hartford observed that there is a lack of clarity about the role
of MSA within the University: Is it autonomous? Is it a student organization
which receives oversight, and who provides this oversight? Are the people who
work for student organizations University employees, and how are they supervised? Vice President Hartford believes that the lack of clarity about these issues
causes tension.
Regent Power noted that the Regents generally support the idea of student
government and have expressed this support by agreeing to assess a fee to support it. However, by enacting this fee, the Regents have an obligation to insure
that the financial propriety among the'student organizations they fund is absolutely perfect, which is why they have required the audits. To that end, he suggested that the vice president for student affairs might report to the Regents on a
regular basis the degree to which financial oversight is welcomed by the organizations.
Further discussion ensued about this idea. Regent Baker pointed out that


-319 -



June Meeting 1992


the Regents have historically supported an independent student government, and
they should not try to control student organizations. Regent Power responded
that the report he suggested might be considered as performing a function similar
to that of an audit committee in a corporation.
1992-93 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly and School/College
Governments
Following further discussion about oversight of MSA financial affairs, Vice
President Hartford introduced Ms. Ede Fox, president of MSA. Vice President
Hartford reviewed the administration's recommendation that the 1992-93 fee assessments be maintained at $627 per student per term for MSA and $1.00 per
student per term for school/college governments and that the $35 cent fee for
Michigan Collegiate Coalition be eliminated. This recommendation is based on
a student referendum in March 1992, in which students voted to cap the MSA fee
at its current level. She pointed out that MSA has prepared its own recommendation of $7.05 per student per term.
Ms. Fox introduced Mr. Roger DeRoo, student general counsel, and Mr.
Hunter VanValkenberg, vice president of MSA. Ms. Fox stated that she has
withdrawn herself from the MSA budget process because her father works for
Student Legal Services. She said she would also remove herself from the organization's discussion of the budget when it is considered for adoption by MSA representatives. She then turned the floor over to Mr. DeRoo.
Mr. DeRoo described the budget process undertaken by MSA, and noted
that organizations receiving allocations from MSA have their own budget oversight. He stated that all money raised by student fees will go into escrow, and will
not be appropriated until approved by a student referendum. He stated that
MSA had recently mandated an increase in its reserve fund from two percent of
its internal budget to five percent of its external budget (approximately $25,000).
Mr. DeRoo reported that MSA officers are requesting an increase of 6.9 percent (43 cents per student per term) over the current rate of $6.27. They are also
recommending that the 35 cents per student per term currently being allotted to
the Michigan Collegiate Coalition be transferred to MSA for appropriation to
MCC, rather than appear as a separate assessment designated for MCC. He then
reviewed the detailed combined budget proposal for Michigan Student Assembly,
Student Legal Services, and the Ann Arbor Tenants Union, and turned the floor
over to Mr. VanValkenberg.
Mr. VanValkenberg stated that he is the chair of the board of Student Legal
Services, and reviewed the proposed budget for SLS. He described SLS as a free,
pre- paid legal service for students. SLS is requesting a 6.67 percent increase,
almost entirely for salaries. He reported that the caseload last year was 3200 for
three attorneys, with 120-130 new cases coming in per month.
Mr. DeRoo then described the activities of the Ann Arbor Tenants Union,
noting that its budget had been cut by 48 percent last year. One of the positive
results of this budget cut had been that AATU had increased its reliance on external sources for funding. The budget calls for partial restoration of funding


-320 -



June Meeting, 1992


from MSA to hire one half-time person to enable full restoration of services and
a more aggressive fundraising effort. A long-term goal is that one-third of the
income of AATU will come from external sources.
Mr. DeRoo concluded his remarks by describing the activities of the Michigan Collegiate Coalition, noting that this organization works in conjunction with
the University's legislative efforts on common concerns, such as obtaining increased state appropriations and increased student financial aid from the federal
government. He reported that Michigan Collegiate Coalition enjoys universal
support among students and assembly members of all political persuasions. MSA
leadership is recommending direct funding of MCC by MSA, rather than through
a separate, mandatory assessment.
Mr. DeRoo summarized MSA's recommendation as amounting to $7.05 per
student per term, of which 43 cents would go toward improved services and programming and 35 cents would be a transfer of the current 35 cent MCC assessment to MSA.
In response to a question from Regent McFee, a discussion ensued about the
scope of services, charges, caseload, and policies of Student Legal Services.
Regent McFee requested information on the full scope of services provide by
Student Legal Services.
Regent McFee commented that the discussion about MSA fees and financial
matters reveals how the relationship between MSA and the administration is
changing, and needs to continue to develop and be explored. She supported Vice
President Hartford's assertion that a strong student government is a positive element in any university.
Mr. VanValkenberg reported that he fully supported MSA's hiring of an accountant, and welcomed the oversight of the vice president for student affairs in
preventing malfeasance or mistakes. He expressed the hope that next year's
management letter would be completely clean.
Regent Baker stated that funding for Student Legal Services is not analogous
to funding for University Health Service, as Mr. VanValkenberg had suggested
earlier. He reviewed the history of mandatory student fees for PIRGIM, an organization for which funding fell dramatically when the fee was made voluntary,
and stated his objection to mandatory fees and their use for political purposes.
Regent Baker stated his opinion that the Ann Arbor Tenants Union is a political
organization and that he objected to student fees being used to pay for it.
Following further discussion, the president called for a 10-minute recess.
The meeting resumed at 3:10 P.M.
1992-93 University Health Service Fee
President Duderstadt called on Vice President Hartford to present the
1992-93 University Health Service fee.
Vice President Hartford reported that the proposal is to increase the fee by


-321 -



June Meeting, 1992


6.21 percent, or $5.11 per student per term. This would raise the fee to $8736
per student per term, from its current amount of $82.25 per student per term.
In response to a question from Regent McFee, Dr. Caesar Briefer, director
of University Health Service, explained that students are not charged for any services received at the University  ealth Service, except for pharmacy, orthopedic
appliances, elective refraction, and certain immunizations. All primary care,
subspecialty care, laboratory and x-ray service is provided at no charge. Any service performed outside of the University Health Service is not covered.
Following further discussion, the Regents turned to the regular business
agenda, noting that the vote on student fee issues would not occur until after
public comments.
Minutes
On a motion by Regent Waters, seconded by Regent Power, the Regents
unanimously approved the                m    inites of the meeting ofMay 14-15, 1992.

Extension, Litigation, and Personnel-Labor Relations. Vice President Kelly submitted Reports on Projects Established, Research and Other Academic Activities, and Summaries    a Selection of a i Current Research and Sponsored Projects.

Baker seconded the motion, and it was adopted unanimously.

Vice President Cosovich submitted the Report of Voluntary Support for the
month of May 1992. He noted that gifts from living individuals were up by 30

Retirement Memoirs
On a motion by Regent Smith, seconded by Regent Brown, the Regents
unanimously adopted the following retirement memoirs:
Morris Bornstein, professor of economics and research scientist, retired from
active faculty status on May 31, 1992, after a most productive career in teaching,
research, and public policy.
Born in Detroit, Professor Bornstein received his A.B., AM., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan in 1947, 1948, and 1952, respectively. He
worked as an economist for the U.S. government from 1951-58, except for a stint
in the military from 1953-55. Professor Bornstein joined the faculty of the
University of Michigan as an assistant professor in 1958. He was promoted to associate professor in 1962 and full professor in 1964, and received the additional
appointment of research scientist in 1977. Professor Bornstein served as director
of the Center for Russian and East European Studies from 1966-69. He had visiting appointments at Harvard University in 1962-63 and at Stanford in 1969-70.
Throughout his career, Professor Bornstein's specialty has been the field of
comparative economic systems, with special attention to the economy of the


-333 -



Jue Meeting, 1992


Soviet Union. A world-renowned expert on the Soviet system of central planning, he is known especially for his contributions to the understanding of the
Soviet price system. As head of the Comparative Systems Project at the University of Michigan, Professor Bornstein originated and obtained Ford Foundation
funding for a series of very influential conferences in the field of comparative systems.
Professor Bornstein has authored and edited numerous books, including a
very successful book of readings on the Soviet economy that went through four
editions. His most recent book, published in 1985, was a monograph on the
transfer of western technology to the Soviet Union. He is also the author of a
large number of academic articles. These range from a classic article on the
Soviet price system published in 1962 in the American Economic Review, through
numerous contributions in more specialized journals dealing with Soviet studies,
to his most recent work on problems of transition and reform in the Soviet
Union.
The Regents now salute this distinguished economist for his dedicated service by naming Morris Bornstein Professor Emeritus of Economics and Research
Scientist Emeritus.
Frances E. Bull, M.D., professor of internal medicine, will retire from active
faculty status on June 30, 1992. She has enjoyed a most productive career as a
respected teacher and leader in medical oncology.
An Ann Arbor native, Dr. Bull received her B.S. degree with distinction from
the University of Michigan in 1948, after which she entered the University of
Michigan Medical School where she earned her M.D. degree in 1952. She received house staff training at the University of Minnesota and at the Mayo Clinic
and then returned to the University of Michigan to complete her training in
oncology. She also earned her M.S. degree from the University of Minnesota in
1963.
Dr. Bull joined the faculty of the University of Michigan as an instructor in
internal medicine in 1957; she was promoted to assistant professor in 1964, associate professor in 1968, and professor in 1974. She served as head of the section
of medical oncology in the Department of Internal Medicine from 1971-78.
During this time, she was responsible for significant growth in the division and establishment of a training program.
Dr. Bull has played a major role in medical student curriculum design, and
her outstanding teaching abilities have been recognized by her winmng the
Senior Residents Teaching Award in 1971 and the Sophomore Medical Student
Teaching Award in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Dr. Bull has remained the
major contributor to the design of the oncology curriculum in medical teaching at
the University of Michigan. In addition to these accomplishments in teaching
and administration, Dr. Bull has made important contributions to the design of
clinical trials in medical oncology.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for her dedicated
service by naming Frances E. Bull Professor Emeritus of Internal Medicine.
J. Robert Cairns, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of
Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active faculty status on April 30, 1992, after

June Meeting, 1992


Professor Cairns received his B.M.E. degree from the University of Detroit
in 1954 and his M.S.E. (engineering mechanics) and Ph.D. (mechanical engineering) degrees from the University of Michigan in 1959 and 1963, respectively.
Before joining the Dearborn campus, Professor Cairns was an instructor in the
Department of Engineering Mechanics at the University of Detroit from 1954-57
and at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor from 1957-63.
Professor Cairns joined the Dearborn campus in 1963 as an assistant professor of mechanical engineering; he was promoted to associate professor in 1965
and to professor of mechanical engineering in 1968. He served as chair of the
Division of Engineering from 1964-75 and dean of the School of Engineering
from 1975-80.
Having been involved in engineering education for more than 30 years,
throughout his career Professor Cairns has lectured nationally, served as a consultant to various corporations, and authored significant publications. He is also
a member of and extensively involved in, many professional engineering societies. Professor Cairns' University service includes membership on many committees over the years, including the School of Engineering Computer Committee,
Curriculum Coordinating Committee, Campus Facilities Planning Committee,
Chancellor's Task Force on Facilities, and the Scholarship Committee.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming J. Robert Cairns Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering.
Ernest H. Y. Chu, professor of human genetics, will retire from active faculty
status on June 30, 1992.
Considered one of the founding fathers of the study of human chromosomes,
Professor Chu completed his undergraduate education in China, and then attended the University of California at Berkeley, where he earned his M.S. degree
in 1951 and his Ph.D. degree in 1954. He hefd positions at Yale University and
Oak Ridge National Laboratory prior to joining the University of Michigan as
professor of human genetics in 1972.
When the introduction of new techniques initiated the modern era in
cytogenetics in the mid-1950s, Professor Chu immediately became involved in delineating the contribution of chromosomal abnormalities to human defects and in
comparative studies of the cytogenetics of the primates. His interests then
evolved toward the field of somatic cell genetics, in which basic genetic problems
are studied by manipulating human cells under cell culture conditions. This approach yields insights into certain important genetic questions which often cannot
be obtained any other way. Professor Chu's early work involved studies of the effects of x-rays and ultraviolet radiation on chromosomes. Later, he focused on
studying the ability of various chemical agents and x-rays to induce apparent genetic changes (mutations) in human cells in culture. Such studies are proving to
be very important in the screening of chemicals for their potential mutagenic
effect on human populations. Characteristic of Professor Chu's career is his
continuing use of the very latest techniques, with ever increasing precision in defining exactly how chemicals and x-rays work in producing genetic damage. His
scientific achievements have been recognized in many ways, most recently, in
1991, by the receipt of the Environmental Mutagen Society Award for life-time
achievement in basic research.
From the time of his arrival, Professor Chu has contributed to the training of
graduate students in the Department of Human Genetics by co-teaching the
course in cytogenetics and somatic cell genetics; he was popular with pre- and


-335 -



June Meeting 1992


postdoctoral students and visiting scientists.
Throughout his career, Professor Chu has maintained a strong interest in furthering the cause of genetics in his native China, and his laboratory has hosted
many students from the two Chinas. For the past two years, he has served as the
acting head of the Department of Biology m the newly-organized Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Ernest H. Y. Chu
Professor Emeritus of Human Genetics.
John C. Floyd, Jr., M.D., professor of internal medicine, will retire from
active faculty status on June 30, 1992, following a most productive career as a
teacher, researcher, and clinician.
A native of Louisiana, Dr. Floyd received his BA and M.D. degrees from
Louisiana State University in 1949 and 1954, respectively. He then undertook his
internship and residency training at the University of Michigan, following which
he servedas a junior clinical instructor, instructor in internal medicine, and assistant coordinator of the Clinical Radioisotope Unit from 1957-59. Dr. Floyd returned to Louisiana State University School of Medicine in 1959 as an instructor
of internal medicine, then came back to the University's Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism in 1960 to enter a fellowship program. Following his fellowship training, Dr. Floyd joined the faculty as an assistant professor of internal
medicine in 1961. He was promoted to associate professor in 1964 and professor
in 1970.
During his tenure, Dr. Floyd made major contributions to instructional, clinical research, and patient care programs in the Department of Internal Medicine.
He was instrumental in establishing the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center and served as director of the Diabetes Center Unit and Clinic from
1977-86, as well as associate director of the center. In 1986, Dr. Floyd also began
serving as an instructor in the Diabetes Epidemiology Training Program in the
Schootof Public Health. A brilliant teacher and outstanding clinician, he has devoted a good portion of his academic career to training medical students, residents, and fellows in clinical medicine.
Over the years, Dr. Floyd has been active in numerous scientific endeavors
and committees furthering the field of diabetes care and research on a national
level. He was especially influential in the American Diabetes Association, serving in various committee roles and as a member of the board of directors from
1974-80. He continues to play an important part in diabetes research as technical
advisor to the Grants Advisory Panel for Research and Development on Health
Care Cost Containment of the Michigan Health Care Education and Research
Foundation and as chair of the Diabetes Policy Advisory Council of the Michigan
Department of Public Health.
Dr. Floyd's exemplary contributions to clinical investigation include having
established himself as a national authority on the physiology of insulin secretion
in humans. He is also wholly responsible for establishing the first radioimmunoassay for a polypeptide hormone to be employed in the clinical laboratories at
the University of Michigan.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his dedicated
service by naming John C. Floyd, Jr., Professor Emeritus of Internal Medicine.
Bert G. Hornback, professor of English, will retire from active faculty status
on June 30, 1992, after a highly productive career as teacher and scholar.


-336 -



June Meeting 1992


A native of Kentucky, Professor Hornback received his AB., M.A., and
Ph.D. degrees from the University of Notre Dame in 1957, 1961, and 1964, respectively. He came to the University of Michigan as an instructor in 1964 and
was promoted to assistant professor in 1965, associate professor in 1970, and professor in 1975. Among his honors are a Distinguished Faculty Award, the Ruth
M. Sinclair Award for Honors Academic Counselling (twice), and the Amoco
Foundation Good Teaching Award.
Professor Hornback has published a number of books on Charles Dickens,
Thomas Hardy, and George Eliot, as well as numerous articles dealing with British authors and, more recently, with issues of education and leadership. Active in
literary arts and the theater, he has written, directed, or performed with the
Wolgomat Society, Lord Chamberlain's Players, and the Umversity of Michigan
Opera Professor Hornback has given more than 250 readings nationwide from
the workss of Charles Dickens, his chief enthusiasm and scholarly focus. He also
wrote    te, hosted, and acted in a tenpart series of 30Sminute programs on The
Dickens World" for the University of Michigan Television Center.
As counselor of undergraduate students, Professor Hornback has often gone
to extra lengths to ensure that honors students could enroll in courses that would
be most useful to them. Most of his upper-level classes are held at his own home,
where instruction in the world of Charles Dickens may be obtained through
examination of the walls and furniture. He has lon been concerned for the
ambience of the learning community as well as for the good of its individual
members.
Professor Homback's friendships with contemporary poets have brought such
writers as Seamus Heaney, Donald Hall, Galway Kinnell, and Wendell Berry to
read        in    again andag ain. Also extraordinary have been his annual
summer trips to Europe with a handful of undergraduates. These trips combine
reading for academic credit with the opportunity to visit monuments of the
Hellenic world, London, Stratford, and the world of Shakespeare, Dublin, and
the worlds of Yeats and Joyce.
Professor Hormback has been a significant member of the University community since his arrival, serving on committees, and stimulating the minds of undergraduates and colleagues alike. He has not forborne to speak publicly to issues
of University purpose and governance. In this, he models himself on the role of
the Greek citizen in its ideal form.
The Regents now honor this distinguished scholar, teacher, and educator by
naming Bert G. Hornback Professor Emeritus of English.

George R Thompson, M.D, professor of internal medicine in the Medical
School and physician in the Health Service Clinic Services, will retire from active
faculty status on June 30, 1992, after a career at the University of Michigan that
has spanned parts of five decades.
Born in Ann Arbor in 1930, Dr. Thompson graduated from Ann Arbor's University High School and received both his B.S. (1950) and M.D. (1954) degrees
from the University of Michigan. After a year of internship at The Ohio State
University, he returned to the University of Michigan in 1955 as a resident in
internal medicine. He served in the U.S. Navy Medical Corps from 1958-60 and
subsequently completed his rheumatology fellowship at the University of Michigan's Rackham Arthritis Research Unit. Dr. Thompson joined the faculty as an
instructor in internal medicine in 1962. He was promoted to assistant professor
in 1965, associate professor in 1969, and professor in 1976.
From 1963-84, Dr. Thompson directed the rheumatology service at Wayne
County General Hospital. In this setting, he trained dozens of rheumatology fellows and hundreds of medical students and house officers. Dr. Thompson was
known as a dedicated and highly effective clinician and teacher. The author of
approximately 50 publications in the field of clinical rheumatology, he has also
been a member and officer of numerous medical and scientific societies, at both
the local and regional levels.
When the University of Michigan ended its teaching affiliation with Wayne
County General Hospital in 1984, Dr. Thompson was appointed acting director
of ambulatory care and staff rheumatologist at the Veterans Administration
Medical Center in Ann Arbor. He held these positions until 1987, at which time
he transferred to the University Health Service as a senior physician.
After his retirement from active faculty status, Dr. Thompson will continue
to be active as a senior clinician and teacher in rheumatology.
The Regents now salute this distinguished clinical scholar for his lengthy and
dedicated service by naming George R. Thompson Professor Emeritus of Internal Medicine.

Review Committee, and commended the work of the committee's chair, Professor Robert Helling. It was noted that this report is submitted in accordance with
Regental action taken in 1976. In response to a question from Regent Power,
Vice President Kelly observed that since 1976, circumstances have changed, and
that it would be appropriate to modify this report. Vice President Kelly agreed
to prepare a proposal for doing so.
Medical Staff Appointments
On the recommendation of the University of Michigan Hospitals Executive
Board, Regent Brown moved, Regent Waters seconded, and the Regents unanimously approved, several appointments to medical staff membership.
The meeting recessed at 3:45 P.M. and reconvened at 4:00 P.M. in the Anderson Room of the Michigan Union to hear Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from the following individuals, on the topics
indicated: Brian S. Knight and Todd Ochoa, students and MSA representatives,
on the proposed 1992-93 MSA fee; Guy Clark, citizen and chair of Michigan Collegiate Coalition, on the Michigan Collegiate Coalition.
Following Public Comments, the meeting reconvened in the Regents' Room
at 4:25 P.M. Chancellor Jones and Provost Simpson were not in attendance.

unanimously approved a fee increase of $5.11 per student per term (6.21 percent)
for University Health Service for 1992-93. The new fee for 1992-93 will be $87.36
per student per term.
1992-93 Michigan Student Assembly and School/College Government Fee Assessments
Vice President Hartford enumerated the four proposals before the Regents:
1) $1.00 per student per term for school/college governments (unchanged from
previous year); 2) Eliminate the current $.35 mandatory fee for Michigan
Collegiate Coalition and instead recommend that MSA fund MCC with its own


-342 -



June Meeting, 1992


funds or by alternate methods; 3) Vice President Hartford's recommendation of
retaining the current MSA fee of $6.27; and 4) MSA's proposal to increase the
MSA fee to $7.05, which would include an increase of $.43 over the current fee
and $.35 to support the Michigan Collegiate Coalition.
School/College Government Fee. Regent Brown moved to maintain the
school/college government fee at $1.00 per student per term. Regent Smith seconded the motion, and it was adopted unanimously.
Michigan Collegiate Coalition. Regent Smith moved to eliminate the mandatory fee of $35 per student per term for Michigan Collegiate Coalition. Regent Varner seconded the motion.
In response to a question from Regent McFee, it was explained that the fee
for Michigan Collegiate Coalition was established four years ago, following a
student referendum requesting that this be done.
Regent Baker observed that he had reviewed the minutes from past meetings
about actions related to the Michigan Collegiate Coalition. In 1988, the Regents
had made strong arguments that MCC, in its lobbying activities, should not take
positions counter to the best interests of the University. He recalled that at the
time of the founding of Student Legal Services, it was made clear that they would
not be allowed to sue the University. Thus, the historical record indicates that
student organizations should not take a position opposed to that of the
University; since MCC has taken such positions, he was in support of Regent
Smith's motion.
Regent Brown stated that although it is difficult for him to go against the
results of a student referendum, he agreed with Regent Baker that the Regents'
original intent in approving funding for the MCC was that it not take positions
contrary to the Umnversity's interests. MCC's support of a proposed constitutional amendment to limit tuition was a fatal mistake, so he would support the
motion.
The vote was then taken, and the motion to eliminate the mandatory fee of
$.35 for Michigan Collegiate Coalition was approved unanimously.
Michigan Student Assembly Fee for 1992-93. Regent Waters moved to set
the 1992-93 fee assessment for MSA at $6.27 per student per term. Regent
McFee seconded the motion.
Regent Brown noted that students themselves had voted to maintain the fee
at $6.27. Regent Baker reviewed the recent history of MSA elections and noted
that the MSA representatives speaking in favor of an increased fee were of a
different political persuasion than the majority of the assembly.
Regent Power stated that he agreed with Regent Brown's concern about
going against the referendum approving the capped rate. He also stated his
opinion that Regents should not get involved in student partisan political activity.
Regent Power also pointed out that the proposal advocating the increased fee


-343 -



June Meeting, 1992


had budgeted the increase to be applied only to Student Legal Services, not for
other MSA operations.
Regent McFee said that she would support the motion, and observed that if
the current motion passes, MSA would still be able to support MCC out of its
current budget. She also expressed a desire to strengthen student government
and develop better communication with it She asked Vice President Hartford to
continue meeting with student government leaders in developing and evaluating
their budget process. She pointed out that the Regents are not adversaries; they
are overseers attempting through whatever means possible to strengthen and
encourage student government so that it becomes a learning experience similar
to that of other experiences they have while they are here.
Following further discussion, Regent Nielsen observed that the referendum
approved by the students appears to state that the students themselves have the
power to determine what fees they will pay, regardless of decisions made by the
Regents. Regent Nielsen then suggested that because of the historical financial
mismanagement and lack of accountability, and reluctance of student organizations to improve oversight of their financial affairs, Regent Waters' motion be
amended to require the MSA executive officers to work with the director of
University audits to develop acceptable accounting procedures. The proposal for
doing so would have to be submitted to the Regents within six months; if this
were not done, the student fee for the winter term would not be implemented.
Regent Waters did not accept this as a friendly amendment. Regent Brown
pointed out that the type of financial oversight suggested by Regent Nielsen is
already in place. Regent Power agreed, and noted that the issue now involves
cooperation between the student organizations and the audit, which is normally
dealt with in a report by the auditor to the audit committee. That is why he had
suggested earlier that Vice President Hartford consult with others and report to
the board about how best to achieve this outcome. President Duderstadt
responded this could be done in the fall.
The vote was then taken on Regent Waters' motion to set 1992-93 MSA fees
at $6.27 per student per term; it carried unanimously.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned. The next
meeting is scheduled on July 16-17, 1992. Regents' transportation, accommodation, telephone, and miscellaneous expenses for the month of May 1992 totalled
$2,893.08.

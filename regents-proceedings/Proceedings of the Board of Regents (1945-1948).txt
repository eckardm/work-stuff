(p. 915)

The Secretary reported that the will of the late Mrs. Mary Rhoda
Swales, who died in the District of Columbia June 9, 1945, contains
the following provision, but as yet no definite word has been received
from the executor as to whether funds are available for the payment
of this bequest:
Item XIII. I give and bequeath to the Museum of Zoology of the University
of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00),
for use in the Division of Birds, for research through the acquisition of material,
or through the provision of scholarships, or other means adapted to the same
general purpose.
The Secretary also reported that the second paragraph of the will
of the late Miss Abby L. Sargent of Bedford, Massachusetts, who died
June 15, 1945, reads as follows:
Two. All the rest and residue of my estate, real and personal, of which I
shall die seized or possessed or to which I shall be in any way entitled or over
which I shall have any power of appointment at the time of my decease I give,
devise, bequeath and appoint to the University of Michigan which shall invest it
and use the income for the General Library of the University. If the authorities
of the University should see fit to employ the whole or a part of this fund in
the establishment and maintenance of the Lawrence Boyd Evans Collection on
Public Law they would associate his name with his favorite field of study. This
bequest is given in recognition of my long friendship with Mr. Lawrence Boyd
Evans, late of Washington.
The executor has not yet reported the amount of this bequest.
The Secretary reported that under the terms of the will of the
late Dr. Lawrence B. Evans, of the Class of 1894 (R.P. 1929-1932,
p. 152) the University was the beneficiary in the event that on the
death of Miss Grace L. Sargent and Miss Abby L. Sargent, Mr.
Norman E. Towson was not then living. Information has been
received that the Misses Sargent are both now deceased, but that Mr.
Towson is still alive and that presumably the University will not,
therefore, benefit from the estate of Dr. Evans.
Resignations were accepted with regret and other terminations
noted as follows (p. 954):

Elementary School and Assistant Professor of Education in the School
of Education beginning with the University year 1945-1946, with
compensation of $3,500 for the period. No addition to the budget is
necessitated by this action because $2,300 was provided in the budget
of the Elementary School and $550 in the budget of the School of
Education for these positions, and the balance, $650, it is understood,
will be paid from the unexpended balance of the appropriation for

1945, with compensation at the rate of $5,200 a year, twelve-month

will necessitate the addition of $3,366.66 to the Salary account of the
Business Office, there being now available in that budget $1,833.34
which can be devoted to this purpose.
On recommendation by the same committee, the Board appointed
Edward W. Saults as Clerk in the Business Office for the period from
July 9 to September 30, at $2,400 a year, twelve-month basis, and
from October 1, 1945, to June 30, 1946, at $2,700 a year, twelvemonth basis. This action necessitates the addition of $2,573.39 to the
Salary account of the Business Office.

Musicology in the School of Music beginning with the fall term    of
1945-1946, with compensation at the rate of $6,000 for the University

the Museum of Anthropology, and Volney Hurt Jones was appointed
Assistant Professor of Anthropology in the College of Literature,

of the Alumni Association that one or two younger alumni be added
to the present Executive Committee, or that in due course one or two
of the present membership be replaced by younger alumni.
On recommendation by Dean Henry F. Vaughan the following were
appointed nonresident lecturers in the School of Public Health during
the fiscal year 1945-1946 (p. 654), with the understanding that all are

In the Summer Program appears an item of $47,900 for an
Emergency Training Course for Psychiatric Case Work Aides. It is
understood that this fund is to be appropriated by the State Administrative Board from the resources provided for veterans by the
Legislature, and that the program would be administered through the
Institute of Public and Social Administration in Detroit. It now
develops that the students enrolled in the course are to become
employees under the Civil Service Commission, and that their stipends
during the course will be handled through the Commission, instead of
through the University. This plan reduces the costs of operation
through the Summer Program to $11,600. The difference, $36,300, was
removed from the Summer Program.

The following pay schedules for the instructional staff of the Extension Service were adopted and made effective as of September 1, 1945:
The proposed payments in the following schedules are recommended for members of the regular University instructional staff with residence in Ann Arbor.
The compensation recommended for two two-hour classes is for two classes taught
on the same day or in such other sequence as to require but one trip per week
to and from the place of instruction. If an instructor offers two classes on
different days requiring two trips per week to and from the place of instruction,
his compensation will be twice that proposed for one two-hour course. When
classes or lectures are scheduled for places not included in the following tables,
compensation will be the same as that recommended in the tables for the place
approximately the same distance from Ann Arbor. For example, compensation for
classes or lectures in Lansing would be in the amounts set forth in the tables
for Flint; Kalamazoo for Bay City.
The recommendations for any two-hour class contemplates one two-hour
meeting per week for sixteen weeks or the equivalent, including organization meeting and final examinations. Compensations for irregular classes, i.e., classes
meeting more or less than sixteen weeks or more or less than two hours per
week, should be computed proportionately in terms of the total number of class
hours.

AUGUST MlEETING, 1945

Actions of the Committee on Budget Administration recorded since
the meeting of the Regents on July 27 were approved as follows (p. 8):
July 16, 1945
By inadvertence the following adjustments in the various budgets listed were
not made at the time of the adoption of the budget for 1945-46, and the committee, therefore, acting under its emergency powers, authorized changes as
follows:
Lynn W. Fry, Plant Extension Superintendent, from $4,800 to $5,200 a year,
twelve-month basis, beginning July 1, 1945, necessitating the addition of $400
to the Salary account of the Department of Buildings and Grounds.
Robert C. Bassett, M.D., Instructor in Surgery, from $1,730 to $2,730 a year,
twelve-month basis, beginning July 1, 1945, necessitating the addition of $1,000
to the Salary budget of the Department of Surgery, Medical School.
The committee also added the sum of $410 to the salary budget of the Department of Surgery to provide salary for the fiscal year for a part-time instructor
in that Department.
Marjorie Harris, Research Assistant in the Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, from $1,730 to $1,980 a year, twelve-month basis, beginning July 1,
1945, thereby adding $250 to the Salary budget of the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology.
July 31, 1945
The committee approved an increase of $150 to the salary of Mrs. Mary C.
Bromage, Assistant Dean of Women, thus making her total salary $3,600 a year,
twelve-month basis, effective July 1, 1945.. This action necessitates the increase
of $150 to the Salary budget of the Office of the Dean of~ Women.
The committee added $425 to the salary of Dean Albert C. Furstenberg, payable from the budget of Medical School, Administration, to make his total salary
$4,425 a year, twelve-month basis, effective July 1, 1945. This adjustment is
made because Dean Furstenberg voluntarily deducted this amount from his own
salary in submitting the budget and added this total to the recommended salaries
of three members of the clerical staff of the Medical School, Administration,
which requests were denied. This action restores the amount to Dean Furstenberg's previous salary and necessitates the addition of $425 to the Salary budget
of Medical School Administration.
At the request of Dean Hayward Keniston the committee approved salary increases for Assistant Professors Frank 0. Copley and Arthur Van Duren for the
period March 1 to July 1, 1945, of $200 and $300 a year respectively for their
increased duties as Director of Admissions with Advanced Standing and as Chairman of the Academic Counselors in the Literary College. These increases were
allowed in the budget for 1945-46, but, as their increased service began as of
March 1, the salary increases are dated back to the beginning of that service.
This action requires the addition of, $166.67 to the Salary budget of Administration, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
The committee disapproved the request of Dr. Lee R. Dice to transfer $50
from the Current account to the Salary account of the Laboratory of Vertebrate
Biology to provide extra compensation for the salary of a proposed graduate
assistant. In the budget $1,700 is now provided for two graduate assistants,
and Dr. Dice was requested, if possible, to make the appointment and use the
allotted amount over a ten-month period, beginning September 1, 1945.
The committee approved an increase in salary of $400 a year for Dr. Albert
H. Wheeler, Research Associate in the Clinical Laboratories of the University
Hospital, to make Dr. Wheeler's salary $3,500 a year, twelve-month basis, the
increase to become effective August 1, 1945. Funds are already provided in the
University Hospital Serologic Consultation fund for this purpose.
The committee declined the request of Dean Ivan C. Crawford for an
appropriation of $933.34 as an addition to the Salary account of the, Department
of Mechanical Engineering to employ Alfred C. Menner, now serving half time in
the Department of Mechanical Engineering and half time in the Department of
Engineering Mechanics on a full-time basis in the Department of Mechanical
Engineering at a salary of $2,240 a year, twelve-month basis, beginning September 1, 1945.
The budget for 1945-1946 provides for a half-time position in Mechanical
Engineering and a half-time position in Engineering Mechanics, but the budget
for the Department of Engineering Mechanics carries an extra $1,100 so that
funds are provided in that budget for the full-time position in case a proper
applicant can be found. The committee, however, indicated its willingness to




58


AUGUST MEETING, 1945


appoint Mr. Menner to the full-time position in Mechanical Engineering provided
funds can be found elsewhere in the budget of the college which can be used for
that purpose.
The committee approved an increase in salary of from $1,800 to $2,000 a
year, twelve-month basis, beginning July 1, for Rosamond Haas, Secretary in the
News Service; Miss Haas was not granted the general salary increase when the
budget was adopted. No addition to the budget of the News Service is necessary
as funds can be found in the unused part of the salary originally approved for
Mr. Lawrence Towe, resigned (p. 954).
August 1, 1945
On request of Mr. Everett J. Soop, Assistant Director of the Extension Service, the committee approved two transfers from University Extension Service
General Instruction account as follows: $3,500 to Extension Administration, Current account, to provide for the publication of the Extension Service News and
$16,500 to provide a Current account in the Extension General Instruction
account.
On request of Dean Ivan C. Crawford, the committee approved an appropriation of $200 from  General Funds to the Engineering Administration Salary
account, and a transfer of $250 from the Civil Engineering Salary account to
Engineering Administration Salary account, to provide the necessary funds for
the salary of Professor John S. Worley, on retirement furlough, as Curator of
the Transportation Library.
On request of Dean. Hayward Keniston, the committee granted leave of
absence to Yasushi Sakimoto, Instructor in the Japanese Language School, without pay, for the month of August, 1.945, to enable him to return his family to
Los Angeles.
August 14, 1945
The status of Dr. Floyd D. Ostrander, Associate Professor of Dentistry, was
changed from full time, for a period of eight months, November 1, 1945, to June
30, 1946, at $5,000 for the period (based on the rate of $7,500 a year, twelvemonth basis, with no private practice), to two-thirds time for the academic year,
or 898 hours' service, at $4,984 for the period (based on a full-time schedule of
1,350 hours, at $7,500). This action was taken because Dr. Ostrander feels that
he cannot accept a full-time appointment at the present time.
The salary of Professor Willett F. Ramsdell, Director of the Civil Affairs
Training School, was changed from $6,750 to $7,200 a year, twelve-month basis,
effective as of July 1, 1945, and $450 was added to the budget of the Civil
Affairs Training School for 1945-46 for this purpose. Professor Ramsdell is
on leave of absence without salary from the staff of the School of Forestry and
Conservation for this year, but had he remained on the staff he would have received a salary of $7,200, as was provided for him in the budget of the School
for 1945-46. Dr. Ramsdell has served the Civil Affairs Training School since
July 1, 1945, under the assumption that his salary would be adjusted, and the
above action was taken accordingly.
The salary of Schubert E. Jonas, Assistant Photostat Operator in the General
Library, was increased from $1,850 to $2,000 a year, twelve-month basis, beginning as of August 1, 1945. This action was taken to equalize Mr. Jonas' salary
with that of a new appointee in the same department, who was not obtainable
for less than $2,000. Mr. Jonas has held his present position for several years
and has given very satisfactory service. The funds necessary to provide this
increase are within the budget of the General Library.
The following resolution was adopted, and the administrative
officers were empowered by the Board to appoint the committees indicated:
WHEREAS, The libraries of the University of the Philippines have been almost
completely destroyed during the current war in the Pacific, and
WHEREAS, The association between the University of the Philippines and the
University of Michigan is an especially cordial one of long standing, and
WHEREAS, The hope has been expressed both in the Philippine Islands and
in the United States that the rehabilitated library of the University of the Philippines might be known as the JOSEPH RALSTON HAYDEN MEMORIAL LIBRARY, and
WHEREAS, A plan for the rehabilitation of the library of the University of
the Philippines had actually been prepared by Dr. Hayden, and its promotion
would have been one of his major interests had he returned to the University;
therefore, be it




AUGUST MEETING, 1945                           59
Resolved, That the University of Michigan undertake the initiation, sponsorship, and promotion of a project for enlisting the aid of cultural, educational, and

Dr. WILLIAM W. BISHOP
Professor WARNER G. RICE
Professor ROBERT B. HALL, Chairman
and further be it
RESOLVED, That the general committee here named be authorized to appoint

On recommendation by the special dormitory committee of the
Regents (p. 8), the following resolutions were proposed and action
taken as indicated:
Resolved, That a multiple story addition be placed on the Maynard Street
side of Helen Newberry Residence and Betsy Barbour House, joining the houses
so that 156 additional students may be housed therein; and be it further
Resolved, That this addition be operated as a separate dormitory; and be it

Adopted
Vice-President Briggs submitted for record the following actions
taken as the result of a mail vote by members of the Board since the
meeting of July 27:
1. 615 Monroe Street. This property, as a result of the mail ballot, was
procured for $20,000. The property abuts on one rear corner of the J. Raleigh
Nelson House, and, after serious consideration by the Office of the Dean of Men,
the Office of the Dean of Worhen, and this office, it was mutually agreed that
the property should be used for the housing of foreign students.
2. 710 Haven Avenue. This property was procured, as a result of the mail
ballot, at $14,000. The immediate use of this property has not been settled, but
it will be of interest to the Board to know that the former owner, Miss Edna
Gurley, in turn bought another residence and is making it into a league house
for girls.
3. 706-708 Haven Avenue. The Regents by mail ballot authorized the
procurement of this property. An offer of $14,000, the appraised value, has been
made to the owner, but up to the present time no acceptance or rejection of the
offer has been received.
4. Corner Hill Street and Olivia Avenue (Huber Property). The Regents
authorized by mail ballot the procurement of the property on the corner of Hill
Street and Olivia Avenue as the site of the Mary Bartron Henderson memorial.
(R.P. 1942-45, p. 950). Furthermore, the Regents authorized the payment of
$12,500 from University General funds and the balance from the Henderson
House Construction Reserve. As of this date the administrator has not been
authorized to sell the property, but as soon as this, matter is cleared the University will file a bid in line with the authorization given in the mail ballot. The
Board will be advised on the bid that is filed at a later date.
5. Jennings Property.
a) Belmore Inn, 1142 Catherine Street
b) Rooming house, 1136 Catherine Street
c) Vacant lot 66 x 132 feet, corner Clark and Ann streets
d) Vacant lot, Forest Avenue across from Couzens Hall
The mail ballot was not conclusive as to what should be done in connection with
these properties. A revised recommendation is included in the Vice-President's
personal program (p. 83).
The following contracts and purchase order, Department of Engineering Research, were placed on file (p. 9):
Contracts
With Whiting Corporation, Harvey, Illinois, for research work on permeability
of filter cakes; at an estimated cost of $6,000. This is a continuation of
work under Project M-475 for the Swenson Evaporator Company (R.P.
1942-45, p. 670)
With Whiting Corporation, Harvey, Illinois, for entrainment separation program; at an. estimated cost of $5,000. This is a continuation of work under

$750, for the academic years 1945-46 and 1946-47:
1. The Scholarships shall be awarded on a competitive basis to students of
outstanding ability who desire to prepare themselves for technical or executive
positions in the furniture industry by following the program of study that has
been formulated co-operatively by the School of Forestry and Conservation and
the Association. Under this program the student will meet the basic requirements
of the Wood Technology Curriculum in the School of Forestry and Conservation,
and will choose as electives in this curriculum such courses as shall be specifically

The following memorials were adopted:
On August 14, 1945, after a distressing illness, Dr. Thomas Albert Knott,
since 1934 Professor of English and Editor of the Middle English Dictionary,
died at the age of 65 years. He was a graduate of Northwestern University in
the class of 1902 and ten years later received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy
at the University of Chicago. Before joining the faculty of the University of
Michigan, Professor Knott, besides serving as Captain in Military Intelligence
during the World War, had had a distinguished teaching career at the University
of Chicago and the State University of Iowa, and had added further to his scholarly reputation by his able editorship of Webster's New International Dictionary.
His powers as teacher, research scholar, and editor were brilliantly displayed
during his years at this University, and his presence among our faculty will be




64


AUGUST MEETING, 1945


sorely missed, not only for the service that he would have rendered, had his
life been spared, but for his kindly, helpful, and friendly personality, his appreciation of the good and the beautiful, and his wholesome, upright character.
Therefore, in recognition of the loss which we have sustained, the Regents of the
University of Michigan has adopted this memorial of Professor Knott, to be
recorded in the Proceedings and to be transmitted to Professor Knott's family,
together with the Regents' assurances of deep sympathy in their affliction.
Joseph Newhall Lincoln, a native of Quincy, Massachusetts, died at his home
in Ann Arbor on August 8, 1945, in his fifty-third year. He was a graduate of
Amherst College in the class of 1915, and had received the degrees of A.M. and
Ph.D. from  Harvard University in 1927 and 1931 respectively, but had for
twenty-two years been a member of the faculty of the University of Michigan
as Instructor in the Department of Romance Languages from     1919 to 1923,
Assistant Professor from 1927 to 1940, and Associate Professor from 1940 to
the present time. He was also until a few months before his death Secretary
of the Faculty of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Professor
Lincoln's scholarship, which was highly respected by his students and colleagues,
was based on his graduate studies in this country, in France, and in Spain, and
expressed itself in his continued contributions to the journals of his profession
and in the publications of this University. Perhaps more importantly, it was
ably transmitted to the students of the University in his classroom. Dr. Lincoln's
value to the institution, however, was not limited to his contribution as teacher
and scholar; his cheerful and co-operative spirit endeared him to the members
of the University community generally, so that his loss will be sadly felt by many
who had come to look upon him as a friend and a dependable co-worker in many
of the diverse activities of the University. The Regents of the University of
Michigan, therefore, has adopted this memorial to Professor Lincoln for inclusion
in the Proceedings, and directs that a copy be transmitted to his family, with
assurances of its profound sympathy in this affliction.
John Johnstone, Associate Supervisor in Physical Education, for the past
sixteen years a member of the faculty of the University of Michigan, died on the
evening of July 25, 1945, aged fifty-nine years. He was a native of Galashiels,
Scotland, and before coming to this country had qualified himself as a navigator and
served as an officer in the British Royal Navy during the First World War. After
further study at the American College of Physical Education, Springfield, Massachusetts, and a number of years spent as physical director in the Young Men's
Christian Association at Chicago, Illinois, and Calumet, Michigan, and as athletic director in the public schools of Calumet and Pontiac, Michigan, he joined
our'i faculty as an instructor in the Department of Intramural Sports in 1929,
after 1931 devoting half of his time to work as a coach, under 'the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics, in fencing and tennis. His title was changed to
Associate Supervisor in 1942. Mr. Johnstone was an excellent teacher, and one
whose cheery disposition and consideration for others gained hosts of friends among
his associates in both the student body and faculty. His ambition and industry are
evidenced by the fact that by spare-time work he earned at this University the
degrees B.S. in Education and M.S., and that he was the author of a number of
articles and manuals in his professional field. His death has brought sorrow to
many, who will sadly miss his inspiriting companionship and the important contribution which year after year he made to the success of the program in physical
education for men. The Regents of the University of Michigan, therefore, has
adopted this memorial for inclusion in the Proceedings and directs that the Secretary of the Board shall transmit a copy of it to Mrs. Johnstone as an expression
of its profound sympathy with her in this affliction.
Record was made of the declination by James L. Lawson of his
appointment as Assistant Professor of Physics for the University year
1945-46 at the November meeting (R.P. 1942-45, p. 791), in order
to permit him to accept an offer from the General Electric Company.
The resignation of Associate Professor Floyd A. Peyton of the
Faculty of the School of Dentistry, effective as of September 1, 1945,
was accepted with sincere regret (p. 45).
Routine appointments, all within the budget, were approved as
follows (p. 27):

Salary budget of the Department of Physics. The other funds necessary for the payment of the salary of Associate Professor Williams can
be had from the unexpended salary released by the resignation of Associate Professor Floyd A. Firestone, whose resignation is reported
below.
The Board accepted with sincere regret the resignation of Associate
Professor Floyd A. Firestone of the Department of Physics, effective
September 30, 1945.
An appropriation of $1,500 was approved to cover the cost of special surveys of housing facilities available for the use of students in
the city of Ann Arbor, recently carried on by the Bureau of Business
Research.




AUGUST MEETING, 1945


83


The following action was taken:
The Committee which administers the Regents-Alumni Scholarships is directed to follow the general principle that no person who has initially been selected
to hold one of these scholarships (or the Michigan Alumni Undergraduate Scholarships) and whose tenure has been deferred or interrupted by service in the
armed forces has thereby forfeited his original expectations of appointment or
renewal; proper allowance, however, should be made in each case for federal aid
to veterans which duplicates the aid extended by the University through the
scholarship.
The Secretary filed an invitation from the University of Michigan
Club of Lansing to the Regents requesting their attendance at a meeting of the Club to be held at 7:30 P.M. on Thursday, March 14, 1946.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to negotiate for the purchase of a rooming house at 1136 Catherine
Street at a price not in excess of $16,000, the present appraised value,
(p. 59).
The following memorial was approved for inclusion in the minutes:
Julius Erwin Schmidt, who had served the University in various capacities
for exactly twenty-two years less fifteen days of retirement and less periods of
absence on account of illness, died in the University Hospital, Ann Arbor, July 15,
1945. He was born in Toledo, Ohio, June 24, 1898, but had spent practically
his entire life in Ann Arbor. He had the traditional German love of music and
attended the University School of Music for three years before entering business
in Ann Arbor. He spent four years in the employ of the old Ann Arbor Savings
Bank, and for three years owned and operated the Cadillac Motor Agency in Ann
Arbor. He began his University service as an accountant in the Treasurer's
Office July 15, 1923. In January, 1926, he was made Assistant Treasurer; July
1, 1931, he became the institution's Investment Officer and continued in this
capacity until June 30, 1945, when he retired.
His first absence for illness began December 14, 1936, and from then on,
though on duty for most of the time, his heart ailment made necessary longer
and longer periods of rest. Always a good business man, he became in these years
of the University's expansion a close and thoughtful student of investments and
investment policy. He gave to his University duties all the devotion which his
failing strength permitted. His faithfulness to duty under heavy handicap, and
his cheerful patience, faith, and unfailing courage will long be an inspiration to
those associated with him in the University Business Office and elsewhere.
In recognition of our sorrow at the passing of this good man and loyal servant of the University, the Regents of the University of Michigan has caused
this statement to be spread upon their official records, and directs that copies
hereof be sent to his wife and daughter and to his mother.
The proper administrative authorities were instructed to investigate
the situation with respect to the loss of salary suffered by Associate
Professor Roy S. Swinton during his incarceration in a Japanese prison
camp following the loss of Manila by the United States forces, with the
understanding that a recommendation may be made to the Board to
recompense Professor Swinton for at least some of this salary (R.P.
1942-45, p. 646).
The following resolution was approved as authority to condemn, if
necessary, the specific properties adjoining East Quadrangle (p. 59):
WHEREAS, The Regents of the University of Michigan, a Constitutional
Corporation of the State of Michigan, desires to secure for the necessary use of
the University of Michigan, land adjacent to land now owned by The Regents
of the University of Michigan, and particularly as a site for building structures
and grounds for the housing of students, which in the judgment of this board
is and should be an integral part of a broad program of education, and the said
corporation does not hold title to sufficient real estate for such purpose, and the
following described real estate situated and being in the city of Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County and State of Michigan, has been selected by The Regents of the

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1945


Actions of the Committee on Budget Administration recorded since
the meeting of the Regents on August 31 were approved as follows
(p. 57):
August 30, 1945
At the request of the Office of the Dean of Women, the committee approved
an appropriation of $510 to pay the board of housemothers in three co-operative
houses for women-Owen, Lester, and Stevens houses-for the fall and spring
terms of 1945-46, based on the rate of $5.00 a week, for a seventeen-week term.
The committee approved the appropriation of $650 as an addition to the
Salary budget of the School of Education, to provide compensation for the University year 1945-46, for Associate Professor Irving H. Anderson, now absent
on war leave (p. 35), who will resume his University duties as of the beginning
of the fall term. Sufficient funds were originally provided in the budget for this
salary, but were depleted to provide part of the salary of Dr. Glenn Max Wingo,
appointed Assistant Professor of Education in the School of Education by the
Regents at the July meeting.
At the request of Dean Russell A. Stevenson, Professor Edgar H. Gault,
Director of the Bureau of Business Research, was voted additional salary of $575
for the five-week period, August 25 to September 30, 1945, from funds provided
from the budget of the Bureau (p. 82).
September 11, 1945
The committee approved the transfer as of October 1, 1945, of $2,992.50,
from the budget of Special Services to the Veterans Service Bureau's Salary
account, and appropriated in addition $900 to the same account. This action was
taken in view- of certain reorganization contemplated as of October 1, proposals
for which are to be submitted to the Regents at the meeting of September 28 for
action (p. 112).
September 21, 1945
At the request of Dr. Louis A. Hopkins, Director of the Summer Session, the
committee approved the use of an amount not to exceed $4,000 now in the
Summer Session Contingency fund to cover the cost of refresher courses to be
given for veterans during the month of October. Authority was also given to make
exceptions to the regulations relating to faculty loads during the summer, for
the purpose of providing instruction for these courses. It is expected that the
tuition fees will fully recompense the University for the cost involved.
Regent Kipke presented the report of Miller, Bailey and Company
on the finances and accounting of the Michigan Union for the year
ended June 30, 1945 (R.P. 1942-45, p. 762). The report was accepted
and placed on file, showing gross income for the period of $705,376.89,
expenditures of $589,794.43, and net income of $115,582.46.
The Board voted to reconsider the proposal that the University
of Michigan stadium be named the Yost Stadium, which proposal was
laid on the table at the meeting of August 31 (p. 55).
The Regents voted that the proposal be referred to the Board in
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics for consideration and recommendation. Regent Connable voted no. Further, the Regents made provision
that if favorable recommendations were received from the;Board in
Control of Intercollegiate Athletics and if Burke, Burke, arid Smith,
counsel for the Regents, should indicate that there could be no possible
legal reason why the change should not be made, that the Regents
would be asked to vote by mail on the proposal to change the name
of the stadium previous to the next meeting of the Board. Regent
Lynch voted no.
The following resolution was adopted (R.P. 1929-32, p. 346):
Resolved, Since the Vice-President in charge of business and finance has
determined, as a result of a study made of the case, that Lotta Mills Hough,
widow of Williston S. Hough, does not have sufficient income to live in the
modest manner which her deceased husband would doubtless want, that the Regents
authorize The New York Trust Company, Trustee of the will of the late Williston




SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1945


91


S. Hough, to pay to Lotta Mills Hough, widow of Williston S. Hough, the sum of
$50 per month from the principal of the Williston S. Hough Trust during the
remainder of her life or for so long as such financial assistance is deemed necessary by the Vice-President in charge of business and finance, and be it further
Resolved, That The New York Trust Company shall be and it hereby is
authorized to make such payments on the direction of the Vice-President in charge
of business and finance until otherwise notified in writing by such Vice-President;
and be it further
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan waive any claim
against The New York Trust Company for payments so made to Mrs. Hough,
it being understood that such payments will be and hereby are accepted by the
University of Michigan as partial advance distribution to the same extent as if
the trust had terminated and the payments were being made to carry out the
purposes of the Will of Williston S. Hough; and it is further
Resolved, That the Regents of the University of Michigan hereby agree to
and do indemnify said The New York Trust Company against any and all
liability asserted by any party whatsoever arising out of or by reason of the
making of such payments.
Further Resolved, That the Vice-President in charge of business and finance is
authorized to execute and deliver on behalf of the Regents of the University of
Michigan any and all releases or agreements which may be requested by The Newt
York Trust Company in order to carry out the arrangements hereinbefore set forth.
On recommendation of the special dormitory committee of the
Regents (p. 59), the following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Vice-President in charge of business and finance be authorized to negotiate the necessary contract or contracts to complete approximately
18,000 cubic yards of grading on the married student housing project site this
fall.
The first sentence of Section 5.19 of the Bylaws was changed to
read as follows:
Salary Payments in Case of Death. In case of death of any employee of
the University while still actively employed, current salary shall be paid to date
of death.
The Board authorized the use of the facsimile signature plate
of R. P. Briggs on all checks issued by the University; it being understood that complete audit and verification of check payments will
continue to be made in the Accounting Department of the Business
Office before the checks are signed. Authorization was also given to
the Assistant Vice-President to sign University checks when necessary.
In the future, therefore, those authorized to sign University checks
are R. P. Briggs, Vice-President, Herbert P. Wagner, Chief Accountant,
Herbert G. Watkins, Assistant Vice-President, Alice B. W. Root, Clerk,
and J. F. Maulbetsch, Assistant Purchasing Agent.
With the understanding that the approval of the Board in Control
of Intercollegiate Athletics and of the necessary Ann Arbor city
officials can be had, the following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Vice-President in charge of business and finance be
authorized to expend up to $40,000 to provide temporary housing for married
veteran students.
On recommendation by the Finance and Property Committee, the
Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to
negotiate for the purchase of property at 711 Tappan Avenue, at a
value placed on this property by the appraisal board (R.P. 1942-45,
p. 894).




92


SEPTEMBER MEETING, 1945


The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the dormitory expansion program and the plan of financing
adopted at the previous meeting of the Regents (p. 59) be amended by withdrawing the proposed addition to Couzens Hall, the estimated cost of which is
$400,000. This action will reduce the sum to be borrowed to not more than
$6,600,000.
On recommendation by Governor Harry F. Kelly and the State
Administrative Board, the following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Regents accept a building on University-owned property
to be erected at the expense of the state for use as a Readjustment Center for
veterans of World War II so long as state funds are made available for the
purpose; and be it further
Resolved, That the Center be operated by the University in accordance
with general University policy.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Regents approve the establishment of a senior administrative position in the field of university relations, the occupant of which will
serve as administrative assistant to the Vice-President in charge of university
relations and be immediately responsible for the public information services of
the University.
The Regents voted that the recommendations of the Provost relating
to the establishment of the Institute of Public Administration be
approved in principle and that he be authorized to make the necessary arrangements to carry the plan into effect, with the understanding
that the plan will be given effect as early as possible during the current year rather than on July 1, 1946, as originally recommended, and
with the further understanding that the appropriate changes in the
Bylaws will be presented to the Board at a subsequent meeting.
The President was requested to appoint delegates to the annual
meeting of the Association of Governing Boards of State Universities
which meets at Ohio State University on November 15, 16, and 17
(R.P. 1942-45, p. 703).
The President placed on file a letter from the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics expressing the committee's appreciation
for the whole-hearted co-operation that the University of Michigan
and its staff have evidenced in carrying out certain aeronautical research

from August 6, 1945, to June 30, 1946, $1,440 a year, vice Ruth Wetherell,
resigned
The leave of absence granted to Professor Harlow J. Heneman
(p. 46) was canceled to permit Professor Heneman to return to his
teaching duties on November 1, 1945, in the Department of Political
Science, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. The salary of
$4,400 for the University year 1945-46 for Professor Heneman is
already provided in the Reserve for Returning Faculty account.
The appointment of Robert L. Williams, Ph.D., as Assistant Registrar, was terminated as of September 30, 1945, and he was appointed
Administrative Assistant on Special Services assigned to the Office of
the Provost, effective October 1, 1945, with compensation of $5,200 a
year, twelve-month basis. It is understood that in accepting this
appointment, Dr. Williams relinquishes all claims upon any administrative position in the Office of the Registrar, and that he recognizes that
this appointment is a special arrangement for the time being and that
it will not necessarily lead to an administrative assignment of a
permanent character. This action necessitates the addition of $3,900 to
the Salary account of the Provost's Office to provide salary for Dr.
Williams for the remainder of the fiscal year 1945-46.
The following appointments to and changes in the staff of the
Summer Program of 1945, all within the budget as adopted, were made
on recommendation of Dr. Louis A. Hopkins, Director of the Summer
Program (p. 75):

The sum of $5,775 was voted to Professor Roy S. Swinton, Associate Professor of Engineering Mechanics, as compensation for the
period during which he was confined by the Japanese in a prison camp
near Manila (p. 83). This amount was determined by using the
formula laid down in the Bylaws for those who are absent from the
University because of illness, plus the University's share of the
premium due on his annuity policy for three years, which amount he
has paid during that period.
Harry A. Towsley, M.D., was reappointed Assistant Professor in
the Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, Medical
School, for the period from September 20, 1945, to June 30, 1946, with
compensation at the rate of $5,000 a year, twelve-month basis (R.P.
1942-45, pp. 957 and 16). This action necessitates the transfer of
$1,951.40 from the Reserve for Returning Faculty to the budget of
the Medical School and an addition of $551.34 to the budget of the
University Hospital, to compensate Dr. Towsley for the remainder of
the present fiscal year. His salary will, therefore, be payable on the
basis of $2,500 from the University Hospital and $2,500 from the
Medical School for the current year.

the current account of the Experimental Program in Adult Education,

will be increased by $5,000 and the unappropriated margin will not
thereby be affected.

Literatures, and of such other departments or members of the faculty of the
University as may from time to time be desired. Approval of membership of the
Committee will be by action of the Executive Board. The Committee shall appoint
its own Chairman.
3. The functions of the Committee shall be to formulate suitable programs of
study, to determine the undergraduate prerequisites for graduate study and to pass
upon the qualifications of students applying for admission to the programs, to
direct the work of students admitted, and to recommend to the Executive Board
applicants and candidates for degrees.
The Committee is further empowered to consult with the several departments
concerned on the content of preliminary examinations and to recommend to the
Dean of the Graduate School the membership of committees which will direct the
development of each individual's program and thesis.
The Committee may make recommendations to the Executive Board with respect to additional courses and staff members for adequate instruction in this general field. Its several actions shall be subject to approval by the Executive Board.
That department of the Institute for Human Adjustment hitherto
known as the Psychological Clinic was designated the Bureau of
Psychological Services, and thereby becomes a responsible agency of
the University for the organization and conduct of testing programs for

of the most effective use of such instruments of measurement.
Further, Esther Schaeffer, Technical Assistant, and Rachel Kinyon,
Testing Assistant, now on the Special Services budget, were transferred as of October 1, 1945, with the same titles and salaries to the

AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT made this.......... day of........................
1945, by and between the DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION of the STATE OF
MICHIGAN, by P. J. Hoffmaster, Director, acting under authority of a resolution
passed by the Conservation Commission on September 18, 1945, as party of the
first part and The Regents of the UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, as party of the
second part
WHEREAS, The party of the first part is in process of acquiring lands in the
Pinckney Area project for purposes of public recreation, and
WHEREAS, The party of the second part has owned and managed for forestry,
education, and research purposes three hundred and twenty acres of land known
as Stinchfield Woods within the easterly part of the Pinckney Area project, and
for many years has planned to expand its ownership to include other lands within
the same project, thus to form a tract comprising the entire block of land bounded
by the Pinckney-Dexter Road, the Stinchfield Woods Road, the Toma Road, and
the North Territorial Road in Sections 11, 12, 13, and 14, Township 1 South,
Range 4 East, Dexter Township, Washtenaw County, and
WHEREAS, The party of the second part has definite plans for placing two or
three observatory domes and a frequency modulation broadcasting station, as well
as for extending its other uses, on certain lands in this block that are peculiarly
suited to such uses, and
WHEREAS, Carrying out the plans mentioned above depends upon administrative control of the necessary land being vested in the party of the second part, and
WHEREAS, Land under administration by the party of the second part for such
uses, could at the same time, be used and enjoyed by the public, and could thereby
also accomplish purposes of public recreation;
Now, therefore, It is understood and agreed as follows:
1. The party of the first part will continue to acquire lands within the
tract or block heretofore described and will convey title of the same to the party
of the second part whenever the party of the second part may have funds available for reimbursement therefor.
2. The party of the second part shall reimburse and pay to the party of the
first part the same amount as the purchase price, plus the realtor's commission,
paid by the party of the first part for each parcel of land to be so conveyed.
3. The tract or block of land heretofore described, as it passes under the
jurisdiction of the second party will be made available for public use by the said
party of the second part, by making scenic high points accessible, through the
establishment of trails, and in such other ways, and to such extent as may be
consistent with the administration of the tract for educational and research purposes. The party of the second part agrees to work out plans for such public use
in close co-operation with the party of the first part.
4. The party of the second part, after providing for its radio requirements,
will preserve without impairment and make available for public enjoyment, such
outstanding views as may be obtained from Peach Mountain, and in general will
preserve scenic values for public enjoyment in the management of the tract.
It will closely co-operate with the party of the first part to best achieve the
objects of interest to both.

with, and consumed in the various departments, branches, and activities of the
said University, and the corporation does not hold title to sufficient real estate
for such purpose, and the following described real estate situated and being in
the city of Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County, State of Michigan, has been selected
by The Regents of the University of Michigan as a necessary portion of the most

The Plant Department reported that the architect now estimates
the cost of the general service building to be $1,900,000, or $400,000
above the original appropriation made by the Legislature owing to the
increased cost of labor and material. The following resolution, therefore, was adopted:
Resolved, That the administrative officials of the University submit to the
appropriate State officials a request for an additional appropriation of $400,000
for the general service building to cover the increased cost of construction since
the appropriation of $1,500,000 was made available.
The Board gave approval to the program for future building needs
of the University as indicated in the following tabulation, with the
definite understanding that it was the consensus of this meeting that
the general executive officers of the University must be vested with
the authority to proceed with the program as a whole by requesting
appropriations therefor from the Legislature at the appropriate time.
The list of immediate construction needs is as follows:
School of Business Administration...................... $1,800,000
Addition to Engineering Building for Aeronautical and
Electrical  Engineering...............................  1,750,000
Addition  to  Chemistry  Building........................  1,250,000
M aternity  Hospital...................................  1,000,000
To provide for an increase in Power House facilities because of
the increased load of servicing the married student dormitories and
the veterans' readjustment center (pp. 92 and 91), and to give a
secondary source of heat and power to the University Hospital, the
following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the University administrative officers be authorized to request
$450,000 from the State officials for the extension of the tunnel system to care
for married veterans' dormitories and the veterans' readjustment center, and to
provide the University Hospital with a second source of heat and power.

Business Office after having served as a Captain in the Army of the United
States, be set at $5,000 per annum, twelve-month basis, with title of Cashier,

This action necessitates the addition of $3,629.05 to the Salary budget
of the Business Office.
All the above actions were by unanimous vote.

To the Board of Regents of the
University of Michigan
We have made an examination of the accounts of the University for the
year ended June 30, 1945. In the course of our audit, we examined or tested
records and supporting documents, made test checks of income and expenditures,
and made a general review of the accounting methods employed, but we did not
make a detailed audit of all transactions.
We have compared the data printed in the following financial report with
the records of the University. Consistent with prior years, the accounts have
been maintained on the basis of cash receipts and disbursements, with adjustment made at the close of each year to reflect the accounts receivable on the
balance sheet.
In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and schedules relating thereto
correctly set forth the financial position of the University of Michigan as at
June 30, 1945, and its operations for the year ended that date.

Dean Russell W. Bunting was authorized to employ Dr. Marcus L.
Ward, Professor Emeritus of Dentistry and Dean Emeritus of the
School of Dentistry (R.P. 1942-45, p. 955), on a part-time basis during the present year. It is understood that the compensation for these
services will probably not exceed $1,000, and that no addition to the
budget will be necessitated by this action.
The Regents approved an appropriation of approximately $18,000
as an addition to the salaries budgets of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, to be expended, as may be determined by the
Provost, to provide additional instructional personnel necessitated by
the marked increase in enrollment. It is understood that distribution

the Dean of the College.
The sum of $3,800 was added to the Salary budget of the Law
School to meet personnel needs of the School incident to the marked
increase in enrollment.
The Board added the sum of $1,500 to the Salary budget of the
College of Architecture and Design to provide, with an amount of
$500 now available in the budget, a total salary of $2,000 for the
University year 1945-46 for Roger Benton Hollenbeck, Teaching Assistant, whose appointment was approved.
On recommendation by the Board in Control of Intercollegiate
Athletics and with the full approval of those alumni who had originally fostered the idea of changing the name of the Michigan stadium
(p. 90), the Board dedicated the stadium to the memory of those
alumni and former students of the University who gave their lives
in World War II. It is understood that the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics has appointed a committee of six, of which the
Director, Professor H. O. Crisler, is to be a member, who will consider the question of whether a memorial should be erected and the
nature of such memorial-its location, cost, and the proper method
of financing. This committee will also decide the time and nature
of suitable dedicatory exercises and make recommendation as to
whether the name of the stadium should remain as it is at present or
whether another name would be more appropriate.
On recommendation of the proper faculty in each case, degrees and

decided at a later meeting.
The Board approved and ratified actions of the Finance and Property Committee as follows (p. 87):

Actions of the Emergency Committee were approved as follows
(p. 87):
October 3, 1945
The committee accepted, with sincere thanks, from Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg a full-sized replica of the two large, bound volumes in which the United
Nations Charter was recorded at the San Francisco Conference, carrying the full




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1945


145


texts in the five official languages of the Conference-English, French, Chinese,
Russian, and Spanish-together with full facsimiles of all the signatures. Senator
Vandenberg has inscribed these volumes to the University of Michigan, where he
feels they will have the proper care and safeguard.
October 6, 1945
On recommendation by the Executive Committee of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, Lindsay Helmholz, Ph.D., was appointed Assistant
Professor of Chemistry, for the fall and spring terms of 1945-46, with compensation of $3,600 for the period. This action necessitates the addition of $600 to
the salary budget of the Department of Chemistry.
Subsequent to the action noted above, it has been learned that Dr. Helmholz
cannot begin his teaching duties until the beginning of the spring term of 1945-46.
It is requested, therefore, that this appointment be approved for the latter half of
1945-46 and the University year 1946-47. This will necessitate no addition to
the budget of the current year.*
October 8, 1945
On recommendation by Vice-President Briggs, the committee authorized an
increase of $2,500, if circumstances require it, to the $40,000 approved by the
Regents at their meeting on September 28 (p. 91), for providing temporary
housing for married students.
Actions of the Committee on Budget Administration recorded since
the meeting of the Regents on September 28 were approved as follows (p. 90):
September 27, 1945
On request of Dr. Howard Y. McClusky, Consultant in Adult Education, the
committee approved a change in the status of the position of Half-time Assistant
in the Adult Education Program from a twelve-month to a ten-month basis without change in total salary of $1,125.
Because Professor Emerson W. Conlon of the Department of Aeronautical
Engineering and Chairman of that Department finds that it is possible for him
to begin his duties on October 1, 1945, instead of at the beginning of the fall
term, the committee approved payment to Professor Conlon of $454 for the
month of October, which amount can be had from the Summer Session Contingency
fund.
At the request of Dean James B. Edmonson, the committee approved an
appropriation of $750 to pay for services to state schools by the School of
Education in co-operation with the State Department of Public Instruction.
It is understood that this amount is fully reimbursable by the Community Health
Service Project of the State Department of Public Instruction.
On recommendation of Associate Professor Robert S. Ford, Director of the
Bureau of Government, the committee approved the appropriation of $504.72
to the budget of the Bureau to provide the balance required for salary of a
full-time secretary, for the period from October 1, 1945, to June 30, 1946, with
compensation at the rate of $1,560 a year, twelve-month basis. The budget as
adopted provided only for a half-time secretary at the rate of $790 a year, of
which amount $124.28 had already been used by October 1 for part-time help.
The President reported that he has appointed Regents Baits, Herbert, and Connable as representatives of the Regents to attend the
meeting of the Association of Governing. Boards of State Universities
and Allied Institutions to be held at Ohio State University on November 15, 16, and 17 (p. 92). It is understood, however, that all members
of the Board are invited, providing they can find it possible to attend.
The Secretary reported that negotiations for the purchase of the
Newkirk property on Peach Mountain, authorized at the September
meeting (p. 113), are going forward and will be completed in due
course.
The Board approved payment for legal services totaling $1,955 as
submitted by Burke, Burke, and Smith, for the quarter ended September 30, 1945 (p. 9); of this amount $926.90 is chargeable to Legal
Fees and Expenses and $1,028.10 to other general accounts.
*Dr. Helmholz finally declined.

As part of the ten-year program of the University of Michigan
Club of Detroit, the following two tuition scholarships were established, each in the amount of $130 a year:
Terrill Newnan Tuition Scholarship of the University of Michigan Club of
Detroit. This scholarship was established in memory of Terrill Newnan, deceased,
son of Mr. Henry L. Newnan, '05-'06. Terrill Newnan was a student here from
1932 to 1934 and during 1936-37. Funds for this scholarship are contributed
by Mr. Henry L. Newnan.
Fred M. Zeder, Jr., Tuition Scholarship of the University of Michigan Club
of Detroit. This scholarship is established in honor of Captain Fred M. Zeder,
Jr., U.S.A.A.F., who entered the service in 1941 while a student in the Engineering College. Funds for this scholarship are contributed by Mr. Fred M.
Zeder, Sr.
Appointments for the above scholarships are to be made for one
year but may be renewed if in the opinion of the administrative officer
of the University the recipient's record has been so meritorious as to
justify reappointment and provided funds are available. The recipients
are to be named from those recommended by the Scholarship Committee of the University of Michigan Club of Detroit, and awards will
be made on the basis of moral character and good citizenship, scholastic
ability and intellectual capacity and achievement, physical ability, vigor
and vitality, and capacity and performance of leadership and success.
These funds are expendable and shall not constitute an endowment.
The Secretary reported the receipt of a copy of the will of the
late Gertrude French, of Rockford, Illinois, in which the University
appears as a beneficiary under Paragraph VII as follows:
I give and bequeath to the 'University of Michigan, located at Ann Arbor,
Michigan, the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00). I hereby make such
gift and bequest in memory of Lieutenant Francis Brown Lowry who attended
the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan and who was killed
in 1918 in the first World War; and I direct that the net income from such
sum be made available for a scholarship or part scholarship for some worthy or
proficient young man who shall take, and pursue a course of study in the College
of Engineering at the University of Michigan. It is my desire that the scholarship be known as the Lieutenant Francis Brown Lowry scholarship, or in the
event such income be used in connection with a part scholarship only that his
name be connected therewith and that the scholarship or part scholarship be
established by the proper authority of the University of Michigan and made a
memorial upon the records of said University to the memory of Lieutenant
Francis Brown Lowry, who gave his life for his country.
No funds have been received as this estate has not been finally settled.
The Secretary reported that under the will of the late Winifred S.
Gettemy, the Regents of the University may benefit as follows:
2. I give and bequeath to the University of Michigan or the Board of Regents thereof the sum of Two Thousand ($2,000) Dollars, in trust, however,
to be used for the establishment of a scholarship of One Hundred ($100) Dollars
annually, to be given at the discretion of said Board of Regents to that white
Junior or Senior student majoring in said University in speech or dramatics, said
student being of B standing and in need of financial aid, no student to be the
beneficiary of this scholarship for more than one year; and in case there be no
student qualifying therefor in any year the One Hundred ($100) Dollars provided for such year shall be advanced to the next year, the provisions of this
section to remain in force until said principal sum of Two Thousand ($2,000)
Dollars and the income thereon shall have been exhausted.

$3,200 for the University year, following the termination of his leave
on war service (R.P. 1942-45, p. 957). No addition to the budget is

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1945


$2,300 for the University year, beginning with the fall term of 1945 -46. The compensation for Dr. Wolfe is available because of the resignation of Dr. Floyd A. Firestone, for whom budget provision had been
made (p. 82). Dr. Wolfe will retain his present position as Research
Physicist, Department of Engineering Research.
Horace Miner, Ph.D., was appointed Assistant Professor of Sociology, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, beginning with the
spring term of 1945-46 and for the University year 1946-47, with
compensation at the rate of $4,200 for the University year. An additional appropriation of $600 will be required, which, with $1,500 available in the budget of the department originally appropriated for teaching fellows, will provide Dr. Miner's salary for the spring term of this
year.
John M. Sheldon was returned to active teaching duty as Assistant
Professor of Internal Medicine, Medical School, for the current fiscal
year, having returned from military service with General Hospital 298
(R.P. 1942-45, p. 957). It is understood that Dr. Sheldon will begin
his duties as of November 1, 1945, with compensation at the rate of
$6,250 a year, twelve-month basis; $3,500 being payable from the
budget of the University Hospital and $2,750 from the salary budget
of the Medical School. No appropriation is necessitated by this action.

Ward, retired (p. 27; R.P. 1942-45, p. 955). This action became
necessary because it was expected that Dr. Floyd A. Peyton, resigned
(p. 64), would have succeeded to at least part of the work released
by Dr. Ward. No addition to the budget for 1945-46 is required.
The status of William Raymond Kendall, Professor of Musicology
in' the School of Music (p. 35), was changed from a full-time to a

d) The Institute and the Department of Sociology to develop co-operative relationships which will make possible an interchange of teaching personnel in the interests of an integrated program and effective use of personnel resources.
The Provost was authorized to make the necessary arrangements
to carry this plan into effect, with the understanding that changes in
the Bylaws giving effect to the plan will be presented to the Board at
a subsequent meeting.
The Provost made the following recommendations, which were
approved by the Board, with respect to the responsibility for instruction and research in the field of art and archaeology:
1. That the Institute of Fine Arts be abolished as of June 30, 1946, and that
the General Fine Arts Development Program be discontinued as an administrative
and teaching unit on that date.
2. That, effective July 1, 1946, responsibility for instruction in the field of
art, undergraduate and graduate, be assumed by the Department of Fine Arts in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and the College of Architecture
and Design, with the understanding that, generally speaking, instruction in the
history and appreciation of art be provided in the Department and that instruction in creative work be provided by the College of Architecture and Design.
3. That the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and the College of
Architecture and Design proceed to develop a well-rounded program of study in
the field of art and that the Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, the Dean of the College of Architecture and Design, and the Dean of the
Graduate School be authorized to take such steps as may be necessary to give
effect to the reorganization of instruction here contemplated.
4. That the Museum of Art and Archaeology as an administrative unit be
abolished as of June 30, 1946.
5. That, effective July 1, 1946, the Museum of Archaeology be established as
an administrative unit; that it be assigned quarters in Newberry Hall; and that
Professor John G. Winter be requested to serve as Director of the 1M\useum of
Archaeology-the function of the Museum of Archaeology to be the collection,
conservation, study, and exhibition of materials and publication in the field of
archaeology.
6. That, effective July 1, 1946, the Museum of Art be established as an
administrative unit; that it be assigned quarters in Alumni Memorial Hall; and
that a Director be appointed from the staff of the Department of Fine Arts or
the College of Architecture and Design-the function of the Museum of Art to
be the collection, conservation, study, and exhibition of works of art.
7. That an Executive Committee of the Museum of Art be established, effective July 1, 1946, consisting of the Dean of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts, the Chairman of the Department of Fine Arts, the Dean of the
College of Architecture and Design, and the Director of the Museum of Art.
8. That a Division of the Fine Arts be re-established, effective July 1, 1946,
for the performance of the advisory functions of a division as defined in the
Bylaws of the Board of Regents; that this Division consist of the following units:
In the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts the Department of Fine
Arts, the Department of Philosophy, the Department of Latin, and the
Department of Greek
The College of Architecture and Design
The School of Music
The Museum of Art
The Museum of Archaeology
and that a General Committee of the Division be appointed, consisting of representatives of the units included in the Division.
9. That a special committee, consisting of the Dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the Dean of the College of Architecture and
Design, the Chairman of the Department of Fine Arts, the Director of the
Museum of Art and Archaeology, and Professor Clark Hopkins, be appointed
for the purpose of effecting the reorganization, with the understanding that it is
authorized to make a division of the museum collections in the field of art and
archaeology now in the possession of the University between the Museum  of
Archaeology and the Museum of Art; and that it is also authorized to make a
division of the instruction and research materials now in the custody of the
Institute of Fine Arts, the Department of Fine Arts, and the Museum of Art




166


NOVEMBER MEETING, 1945


and Archaeology among the Department of Fine Arts, the College of Architecture and Design, the Museum of Art, the Museum of Archaeology, the Museum of Anthropology, and the General Library of the University.
10. That the committee mentioned in (9) above be authorized to recommend
to the Provost the appropriate assignment or reassignment of the personnel of
the Museum of Art and Archaeology and the General Fine Arts Development
Program in order most effectually to carry out the purposes herein outlined.
11. That the Vice-President in charge of business and finance be authorized
to make such rearrangements of space and provide for such transfer of materials
as may be required to give effect to the reorganizations here contemplated.
The Provost was authorized to make the necessary arrangements
to carry the plan into effect, with the understanding that changes in
the Bylaws giving effect to the plan will be presented to the Board at
a subsequent meeting.
On recommendation by the Engineering Faculty, the Bachelor of
Science in Engineering degrees and curriculums in the three combined
curriculums of engineering-law, engineering-business administration, and
engineering-forestry were discontinued (R.P. 1932-36, p. 348, and R.P.
1929-32, p. 130) for the following reasons:
1. Under the present arrangement students in these curriculums secure engineering degrees without having taken an appreciable amount of the engineering
courses of the senior year. Inasmuch as engineers must now be licensed in fortyseven or forty-eight states of the Union, it is the feeling of the Faculty of the
College of Engineering that the granting of bachelor's degrees in engineering to
students who have not taken the work of the senior year will react unfavorably
on all of our degrees.
2. These curriculums have been in operation for from ten to fourteen years
and have attracted but relatively few students.
3. Students desiring to do so, may continue work in law, business administration, and forestry after having completed the entire engineering curriculum.
It is understood that students now enrolled in these curriculums are
to be permitted to complete their work, but that no new         enrollments
will be accepted after July 1, 1946.
Pending the appointment of a new director following the resignation of Associate Professor of Zoology Frederick M. Gaige (p. 95),
and on recommendation of the University Museums Advisory Board,
Associate Professor William H. Burt, Curator of Mammals, was designated Acting Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Museum
of Zoology (R.P. 1942-45, p. 912).
Since May 27, 1927 (R.P. 1926-29, p. 228), the Registrar of the
University, either personally or by duly authorized deputy, has been
authorized to endorse disbursement vouchers of the University in lieu
of one of the Regents, prior to sending them to Lansing for filing
with the Auditor-General. Under a recent decision by the AuditorGeneral, there is no further necessity to file these vouchers in Lansing.
The Regents, therefore, rescinded the action authorizing the endorsement on the vouchers by the Registrar.
On recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Alumni Association, the following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Alumni Association recommend to the Board of Regents
for approval that Myra Beach Jordan and Frederick Parker Jordan and the survivor of either be made the recipients for life of all of the income, including the
income accumulated since the death of the former recipient, from the Williams
Professorship Fund, and that said income and accumulated income be distributed
to the said Myra Beach Jordan and Frederick Parker Jordan and the survivor
of either, in equal monthly installments, so far as practicable, retroactive as of
July 1, 1945.

in charge of business and finance, or Secretary, be authorized to sign a letter of
intent protecting the George A. Fuller Company for the costs incurred and commitments made on the Married Student Dormitories prior to the signing of the

if the definitive contract is not signed by January 15, 1946, the George A. Fuller
Company may be discharged from the job and reimbursed for its costs, and provided further that if the costs on the Married Student Dormitories exceed the
estimates by more than five per cent that the Board may elect, up to January 15,
1946, to complete only the Married Student Dormitories and the fee shall be
limited to $28,000.
At the request of the trustees of the estate of the late Jessie G. M.

and Property Committee, the following resolution was adopted:
169




170     SECOND NOVEMBER MEETING, 1945

regarding the admission of students for the spring term of the present
University year. It is understood that the executive officers of the
University are authorized to modify from time to time the provisions
of this action as the exigencies may demand. In short, the situation
with respect to housing is such that extreme care must be used in
accepting applications for admission of students from outside the
state, both veterans and others. It is expected that by January 15
the admission officers will be in a better position to determine to what

of activities of the Bureau of Public Health Economics established by
the Regents at its meeting on November 3 as an adjunct to the
Department of Public Health Practice, School of Public Health, for
report back to the Board if further action be necessary (p. 163).
The President informed the members of the Board of the death
of Dean Clarence S. Yoakum       on November 20, 1945. The following
memorial was later prepared and is here inserted for record:
The association of Clarence Stone Yoakum with the University of Michigan
extended over a total of twenty years. In this time those who were privileged to
know him came both to prize the gentleness of his friendly, helpful nature, and to
esteem the breadth of his knowledge of the educational field which, combined with
excellent judgment and executive ability, made him a notable officer of instruction
and administration. Before joining the faculty of this University he had gained
distinction as a psychologist specializing in problems relating to personnel and
had made his talents effectively available to the United States Army during the
First World War. At Michigan, besides giving further demonstration of his
powers as a teacher and investigator, he co-operated with many faculties and
faculty groups as a general officer of the University in charge of educational
investigations, to the end that the institution might more capably perform its
functions, and its activities be directed in the proper channels. As Dean of the
Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies his influence toward clarifying
the objectives of the School and introducing an orderly, efficient administration
of its affairs, his guidance of this unit through a period when both its enrollment
and its resources were immensely increased, and his efforts to promote scholarly
investigation in all departments of the University constitute achievements that
could be looked for only in an administrator of superior gifts and wide interests.
It is certain that the sense of loss which we have all experienced through his
sudden death will be heightened from year to year in the future; it is equally
certain.that the coming years will increase our admiration for his accomplishments
and our appreciation of his services to this institution. The Regents of the University of Michigan, therefore, have adopted this memoir as an expression of their




190         SECOND NOVEMBER MEETING, 1945
respect for the late Dean Clarence Stone Yoakum and have directed that it be
incorporated in their proceedings and that an official copy be transmitted to his
surviving family, together with the assurance of their deepest sympathy with
them in their bereavement.
Coincident with the action taken by the Regents at the meeting on
November 3, when the Institute of Social Work was established
(p. 164) it was understood that Robert W. Kelso, Professor of Social
Service would act as Director of the Institute of Social Work. Record
is here made of this appointment.
Regent Baits's traveling expense voucher for attendance at the
meeting of the Association of Governing Boards of State Universities
and Allied Institutions (p. 170), held at Ohio State University, November 15, 16, and 17, in the amount of $27.37, was approved.
Travel expense vouchers of Regent Connable for attendance at the
meetings of September 28 and November 30, and for attendance at
the Association of Governing Boards of State Universities and Allied
Institutions, in the total amount of $116.09, were approved.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to meet on January 4, 1946, at 2:00 P.M.

192


JANUARY MEETING, 1946


creased from $5,200 to $5,500 a year, twelve-month basis, beginning
January 1, 1946 (p. 184). These increases necessitate the addition of
$450 to the salary budget of the Plant Department.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Regents of the University, conscious of its responsibilities
for the welfare of this institution and the quality of its educational performance
in the interests of the people of the State, feels impelled to bring to the attention
of the Governor and the Legislature of the State the urgency of the present
needs of the University.
For seventy-five years and more, the University of Michigan has had an assured place among the most distinguished educational institutions in this country
a fact of immeasurable importance to the State itself and to those whom it
has served through the years. It has long been known as the "Mother of State
Universities" and, more than any other institution in this country, it has stood
out as the great example of publicly supported higher education.
This distinguished place is accounted for fundamentally by the quality of the
University's educational achievements, but these achievements have been made
possible by the support which it has received from the people of the State and
their representatives in its government.
The exigencies of an extended industrial depression and of war have imposed
serious limitations upon this public support during the past twenty years. These
limitations were unavoidable, and they were accepted as such by those charged
with official responsibility for the welfare of the University. The inevitable result,
however, has been an accumulated deficiency-both in terms of physical facilities
and in terms of income for current operations.  As a result, the University now
finds itself seriously handicapped in its attempt to maintain the quality of some
of its educational programs. The Regents now urge that consideration be given
to this situation and that, in the forthcoming special session of the Legislature,
provision be made for the most urgent of the pressing building needs.
In laying this matter before the Governor and the members of the Legislature at this time, the Regents feel that they would be derelict in their duty if
they did not share with the representatives of the people of the State their own
deep concern for the welfare of the University and their conviction that its position of leadership is now seriously endangered.
The following recommendations of the executive officers of the
University were approved by the Board:
That the Regents direct the Committee on Fees to undertake a new study
of outstate fees, having in mind (1) the desirability of making them more nearly
relative to cost of education, (2) the reciprocal advantages offered by. other state
universities to Michigan residents, (3) special considerations relating to the resources and obligations of certain schools and colleges within the University, and
(4) the importance of maintaining the national character of this institution.
That the executive officers of the University be authorized to proceed, in consultation with the deans and directors of the several schools and colleges, to give
effect to an emergency' admissions policy which will take into account the following considerations: (1) the academic qualifications for pursuit of study in the
University; (2) the legitimate expectations of the people of the State that no
academically qualified resident of the State shall be denied admission to the
University because of the admission of outstate students, other than veterans;
(3) the national interest in the education of veterans; (4) the reasonable expectations of outstate alumni and alumnae who desire educational opportunities for
their sons and daughters; (5) the University's national or regional obligations in
certain fields of study; and (6) the long-run policy of maintaining the national
character of this institution.
The following statement of policy, recommended by the executive
officers of the University, was approved:
In making its long-run plans for the future, the University is proceeding
with full realization that its educational responsibilities are measured by the
educational needs of the State. If there should be larger demands upon its educational resources by qualified applicants for admission from the high schools of
the State, the University is prepared to enlarge the scope of its operations and to
meet these demands in keeping with the high purposes for which it exists. OtherNwise, it has nro interest in increased size;




JANUARY MEETING, 1946


193


In requesting appropriations for additional physical facilities, however, the
Regents are measuring the needs of the University in terms of its present educational responsibilities. These requests are not based upon plans for prospective
substantial growth. All of the buildings requested are essential to the conduct
of the present educational program in accordance with modern standards of instruction and, on a basis which will be worthy of the young men and women who
pursue their studies in this institution.
The Board approved and ratified actions of the Finance and
Property Committee as follows (p. 170):

The Secretary reported for record the terms of the will of the late

have been received:
Second: (b) In the event of my death without leaving widow or issue me
surviving, I give, devise and bequeath to the Regents of the University of Michigan, a constitutional corporation, all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate
of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate which I may own or to which I may
be in anywise entitled at the time of my death, for the purpose of creating a fund
to be administered by the said Regents for the following uses and purposes:
1. Said Board of Regents shall be authorized in their sole and absolute discretion from time to time to invest and reinvest all or any part of the principal
of said funds in such property, real or personal, as they may in their sole and
absolute discretion deem advisable....
2. The said Board of Regents shall use the income from said fund for medical
research.
3. In the event that in the opinion of said Regents the needs to meet which
this bequest is made should pass out of existence with the passage of time or not
require all of the income herein provided for, then the said Regents are hereby
expressly given authority and charged with the duty to use the said income or so
much of it as in their discretion may seem for the best advantage of the University
for other purposes allied to or in harmony with the spirit and purpose of this
bequest as above expressed..
4. If after this bequest shall have been in operation for ten (10) years or
more the said Regents, within their discretions as Trustees shall believe that my
general purpose in making this bequest would be better served by the expenditure
of both principal and income than by the continued expenditure of income only,
then and in that event the said Regents are expressly authorized and empowered
to sell securities or other property in which such principal shall then be invested
or to sell any part thereof and to expend the proceeds thereof as may in their
opinion at that time be as near as feasible to the purposes hereinabove set forth
for the best advantage of the Medical School of the University of Michigan, or
of the University of Michigan in any phase of its then accepted and proper
activities.
The Regents accepted, with sincere thanks to the donor, Miss
Isabelle Stearns of Worcester, Otsego County, New York, a Russian
amethyst, emerald, and pearl enameled necklace, in memory of her
brother, Chilton Rupert Stearns, A.B. '96. This necklace is a replica of

On recommendation of the faculty of the College of Engineering,
a four-year curriculum in mechanical and industrial engineering, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering (IndustrialMechanical Engineering), in place of the present five-year curriculum,
was approved, effective at once. The proposed new curriculum makes
no change in the basic requirement, and a total of 140 hours of credit
is necessary for the degree. Students wishing to take further work in
the Graduate School leading to the Master of Science degree in the
industrial field would, it is understood, find no difficulty in the selection of courses in engineering, economics, business administration, or
other divisions to suit the requirements.

armed forces of the United States were candidates for the master's degree or other
professional degree at the master's level and had successfully completed at least
three-fourths of the requirements for the degree, and who died while they were
in the service, be awarded their degrees, Honoris Causa; and be it further
Resolved, That when such students are awarded their degrees the notation,
Honoris Causa, be posted to their records, and that the nearest of kin of men or
women so honored be appropriately notified of the action.
Lieutenant Thomas F. O'Loughlin, U.S.N.R., was appointed Assistant Professor of Naval Science and Tactics, from December 4, 1945,
to date of detachment by the Navy Department, with the understanding that his salary is to be paid by that Department.
Mrs. Evans Holbrook was appointed to membership in the Board
of Governors of Martha Cook Building, to succeed herself, for the
period January 1, 1946, to December 31, 1948 (R.P., 1942-45, p. 164).
On recommendation by the faculty of the School of Nursing, the

On recommendation by the Finance and Property Committee, the
following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That securities received as gifts for the Cooley Memorial Building
fund shall be liquidated by the Business Office as soon as possible after receipt,
without further authority from the Board.
At the meeting of the Regents on November 30, a request from
the Michigan Varsity M Club, to establish a scholarship fund bearing
the name of the Club, was referred to the Vice-President in charge of
University relations for study and report (p. 172). Following the report of Vice-President Niehuss, the Regents gratefully accepted the
proposal to establish this scholarship, under the terms and conditions,
but with the understanding that: (1) final selection of candidates be
made by the University Scholarship Committee; (2) candidates meet
the usual requirements for first-year scholarship holders; (3) the committee have the right to reject all candidates proposed in a given year
if in the judgment of the committee they are not academically qualified.

JANUARY MEETING, 1946


On recommendation by the President, the following memorial is
included in the record:
Bryson Dexter Horton, B.S.(E.E.)'95, D.Eng.(hon.)'39, died in Ann Arbor
on December 14, 1945, aged seventy-four years. Throughout his long and useful
life Mr. Horton exemplified the character which this University regards as typifying its best ideals. As a young man he joined that notable group, many of them
from the University of Michigan, who manned the U.S.S. "Yosemite" during the
Spanish-American War. In his professional career, his energy, integrity, and
inventive skill won him an honored position in the industry of the nation and
permitted him to contribute importantly to the improvement and safety of its
manufacturing methods. To his fine sense of values and his keen interest in the
betterment of mankind through education and more favorable social conditions, is
due much of the effectiveness of the Horace H. Rackham and Mary A. Rackham
Fund in its efforts to carry out wisely the intentions of the donors. His service as
chairman and treasurer of that Fund was in every good sense a public service,
faithfully, skillfully, and honorably executed, with no thought of personal profit
or praise. In recognition of the accomplishments of this valued and loyal alumnus
of the University, whose life has meant much to the welfare of this State and its
institutions, the Regents of the University of Michigan have adopted the foregoing memoir as a permanent record incorporated in their official Proceedings,
and have directed that a copy be transmitted to MIr. Bryson Dexter Horton's
surviving family.
Traveling expense vouchers were approved as follows: Regent
Lynch for the period January 1 to December 31, 1945, $78.13; Regent
Hayward for the same period, $214.10; Regent Herbert for attendance
at the meeting of November 3, $79.10, for attendance at the meeting
of the Governing Boards of State Universities and Allied Institutions.
Columbus, Ohio, November 14 to 17, $128.65, and the meeting of
November 30, $77.51.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to meet February 1, 1946, at 2:00 P.M.
HERBERT G. WATKINS, Secretary

The Secretary filed the pertinent paragraphs of the will of the late

the terms of which the University of Michigan is a beneficiary as
follows:
17. Out of the excess, if any, of such funds, I desire that there shall be
established a perpetual Trust in the sum of Fifty Thousand ($50,000.00) Dollars,
to be known as the Maximilian and Reba E. Richter Scholarship Fund, at Bryn
Mawr College; and a perpetual Trust in the sum    of Twenty-Five Thousand
($25,000.00) Dollars, to be known as the Maximilian and Reba E. Richter
Scholarship Fund, in memory of Dr. Sol Eisenstaedt, at the University of Michigan, the proceeds of each fund to be used by the authorities of the said colleges
to provide support or assistance for one or more students in the obtaining
of either an academic or professional degree. The funds shall be administered upon a nonsectarian basis and shall be awarded to such applicants as the
said authorities may deem worthy of such assistance by reason of habits of
character and scholarship. No conditions or promises shall be exacted from the
students so benefited, but it is hoped that if their means shall at any time be
sufficient to enable them so to do, they will contribute to the trustees administering such funds, such portion or portions of the advances made to them as they
may, of their own accord, desire so to contribute in order that similar aid may
be extended to others. Such students shall be selected from among the graduates
of the public high schools and/or the public colleges of the City of New York,
either upon their own application or upon recommendation of any appropriate
committee or committees of such colleges or high schools.
In a codicil to Mr. Richter's will, executed June 14, 1944, the
following item appears:
15. If the bequest to the University of Michigan shall take effect pursuant to
the provision of Item "Tenth" of my Will, it is my desire that the income therefrom shall be used solely for the benefit of one or more students at its medical
school.
According to the executors, the estate will be of sufficient size eventually to complete the trust of $25,000 contemplated by the provisions
of that paragraph for the creation of a scholarship fund in the Medical
School.
The Secretary filed the following paragraph from      the will of the
late Orla B. Taylor as follows:




224                  FEBRUARY MEETING, 1946
(1) To the Regents of the University of Michigan, the sum of $20,000, for

The Board was advised of the formal retirement of former Dean
Edward H. Kraus (p. 185), which takes effect at the end of the present
term, February 23, 1946. On recommendation by the President, the
following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That on the occasion of the retirement of Edward Henry Kraus,
Dean Emeritus of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and Professor
of Crystallography and Mineralogy, the Regents of the University of Michigan
hereby record their appreciation of the noteworthy service which Dr. Kraus has
rendered to this institution in the forty-two years since he first became a member
of its faculty. As a leading authority in the field of his specialization, the founder
and first president of the Mineralogical Society of America, and the guide and
director in their advanced studies of many who have followed him as teachers and
investigators in this branch of science, Dr. Kraus has brought prestige to himself
and the University of Michigan. His ability as an administrator was discovered
soon after his first appointment at Michigan and has been utilized continuously
since that time, at first as the head of his department, later as executive secretary
for the program of postgraduate study which preceded the establishment of the
Graduate School, for twenty-five years as secretary, acting dean, and dean of the
Summer Session, for thirteen years as acting dean and dean of the College of
Pharmacy, and from 1933 to 1945 as dean of the College of Literature, Science,
and the Arts. In all these capacities Dr. Kraus displayed unusual capacity for
leadership and the development of sound organization; he participated actively
and effectively in the regional. and national associations of educational administrators, and gained a wide reputation for sound counsel in educational matters.
In view of the foregoing be it
Resolved, By the Regents of the University of Michigan, that they extend
to Dr. Edward Henry Kraus their cordial thanks for his long and distinguished
service and their sincere wishes for his continued health and happiness, and be
it further
Resolved, That Dr. Edward Henry Kraus be retired in accordance with the
provisions of the Bylaws of the University from active service as of February 23,
1946, with retiring allowance as provided by the regulations and with the title
Dean Emeritus of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and Professor
Emeritus of Crystallography and Mineralogy, and that he be cordially invited to
avail himself of all the privileges customarily extended to emeritus members of
the faculty.
Dean Ivan C. Crawford notified the Regents of the retirement on
February 23 of Professor Arthur J. Decker, of the Department of
Civil Engineering, who has reached the age of sixty-five and desires to
be retired on account of illness. Professor Decker has been a member
of the staff of the Department since 1909, and his retirement was
approved by the Board with sincere regret and with the understanding
that he is to receive such retirement income as is commensurate with
the situation (R.P., 1942-45, p. 819).
The following resolution was adopted:
WHEREAS, Arthur James Decker, Professor of Civil Engineering, and a mem



FEBRUARY MEETING, 1946


227


ber of the faculty of the College of Engineering since October, 1909, has requested
that he be retired at the end of the fall term of 1945-46, and
WHEREAS, Professor Decker has throughout his association with this University, of which he is a graduate in the Class of 1905, loyally and skillfully
served as a teacher in the field of sanitary engineering, and has gained high
standing in his chosen profession; therefore be it
Resolved, By the Regents of the University of Michigan, that Professor
Arthur James Decker, be permitted to retire from active service on February 23,
1946, with retiring allowance as provided by the regulations of the University
from that date; and be it further
Resolved, That the title Professor Emeritus of Civil Engineering be conferred
upon Mr. Decker, and that this Board hereby records its appreciation of the
noteworthy services which he has rendered to this institution and its students
throughout the past thirty-five years, and expresses the hope that he may enjoy
health and happiness throughout the years of his retirement.

At the meeting of the Regents on February 23, 1945 (R.P., 1942-45.
p. 858) the Board voted that in the interests of public relations the
tuition fees for veterans, residents of Michigan or nonresidents,
should be determined on the basis of their legal residence as construed
for all other students. This rule was effective with the beginning of
the spring term of 1944-45. By the amendment of Public Law 346,
the provision for the deduction of tuition from any future adjusted
compensation has been eliminated, and the Vice-President in charge
of business and finance was authorized and directed to charge nonresident tuition for all veterans enrolled under Public Law 346, effective
with the beginning of the fall term of 1945-46. The Regents also
approved authority to the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance to negotiate new contracts under Public Law 16, and, in so
doing, to attempt to secure terms which are consistent with those recommended above for students enrolled under Public Law 346. The VicePresident in charge of business and finance was also authorized to
attempt to negotiate an amendment to our present contracts under
Public Law 16 to provide for tuition consistent with the recommendations regarding tuition under Public Law 346.

On March 30, 1945 (R.P., 1942-45, p. 862), the Regents assigned
to the executive officers of the University responsibility for the continuing study of the plant extension needs of the University. The
following bylaw giving effect to this action was approved:

It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Board of Regents that all plant
extension needs of the University shall be submitted through and by the committee
hereby constituted, and that no person connected with the University, without
express authority of the Board, shall represent, directly or indirectly, the position
of the University concerning plant extension needs, or submit requests, to any
responsible officer of the state or the federal government. The President, or his
representative, is hereby authorized to act for the committee and the University
in connection with such representations and requests (R.P., 1942-45, p. 862).

The following statements presented by the President were adopted:
On January 30, 1946, Campbell Bonner, Ph.D., Professor of the Greek
language and Literature, became seventy years of age and entitled to retirement in accordance with the Bylaws of this University. Professor Bonner's career
has been a distinguished one, gaining signal honor for himself and for the institution of whose faculty he has been a member for the past thirty-five years. His
broad knowledge of the ancient languages and cultures, displayed in his writings
and shared with the young scholars who have come under his guidance, is recognized by his colleagues here and in other lands; it has brought him membership
in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical
Society and the honor of presiding over the American Philological Association,
the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, and the Michigan
Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters; and upon our own campus he has been
honored by selection as Henry Russel Lecturer. The Regents of the University
of Michigan, upon this occasion of his retirement, congratulate Professor Bonner
upon these notable achievements and express to him their gratitude for the
services which he has rendered; they confer upon him the title Professor Emeritus
of Greek and invite him to avail himself of all the privileges customarily extended to emeritus members of the faculty.
Morris Palmer Tilley, Ph.D., Professor of English, a native of Virginia, and
a graduate of the university of that state, joined the faculty of this University
in 1906. Having reached the age of seventy years on February 7, 1946, he has
become eligible for retirement in accordance with the Bylaws of the Board of
Regents. During the forty years of his service here Professor Tilley has endeared himself to many a student and colleague, and he has likewise contributed
with great industry and acumen to the scholarly literature of his field. In
particular, his studies of the proverb in England have been thoroughgoing and
definitive, and seem destined to bring lasting credit both to him and to the
institution under whose auspices the work was carried out. The Regents of the
University of Michigan, therefore, cordially felicitate Professor Tilley upon his
achievements as scholar and teacher, and confer upon him the title Professor
Emeritus of English. They extend to him all good wishes for the future and
invite him to avail himself of all the courtesies customarily accorded to emeritus
members of the faculty.
Vincent Collins Poor, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Mathematics, having
reached the age of seventy years on January 31, 1946, has, therefore, become
eligible for retirement under the Bylaws of the University. The Regents of the
University of Michigan hereby record their appreciation of his service to this




SECOND FEBRUARY MEETING, 1946


245


institution during the past thirty-nine years. His long association with students in
his department, and his ripe experience in the presentation of mathematical subjects to learners, have made him a valuable member of the teaching staff; and
at the same time his contributions to mathematical literature and his authorship
of textbooks have brought him credit here and elsewhere. It is the hope of the
Regents that the years of his retirement may be blessed with health and
happiness, and they confer upon him the title Associate Professor Emeritus of
Mathematics, inviting him to avail himself of the courtesies customarily extended
to emeritus members of the faculty.
The Regents of the University of Michigan hereby record their appreciation
of the long service of Clifton O'Neal Carey, Associate Professor of Geodesy and
Surveying, who, having reached the age of seventy years on December 1, 1945.
has become eligible for retirement, under the Bylaws of the University. A
graduate of both Wilmington and Haverford colleges, Professor Carey received
the degree B.S.(C.E.) from the University of Michigan in 1906 and the degree
of Civil Engineer in 1914. His association with this University as a member of its
faculty began in 1908 and has been broken only by the period of his absence
from this country in 1918-20 when he took an important part in the Chinese
Grand Canal project. His interest in the subject of his specialization has continued undiminished throughout this time, which has been characterized    by
participation in the activities of the professional societies and devotion to his
duties as a teacher of young engineers. In recognition of Professor Carey's many
valuable contributions to the success of the University's undertakings, the
Regents of the University of Michigan confer upon him the title Associate Professor Emeritus of Geodesy and Surveying and invite him to avail himself of
the privileges customarily enjoyed by emeritus members of the faculty.
The resignation of Boyd C. Stephens, Cashier of the University, was
accepted   with  regret, effective March     5, 1946.   Mr. Stephens has
accepted a position with the Veterans Administration (p. 119).
Gordon B. Jory was appointed Cashier of the University, effective
February 1, 1946, with compensation at the rate of $3,300 a year,
twelve-month basis. This appointment requires no addition to the
budget.
The resignation of Associate Professor Harlow         J. Heneman was
accepted, effective January 31, 1946. This action cancels the leave
granted to Dr. Heneman on account of illness, for the period January
4 to March 4, 1946 (p. 234).
The resignation of Dr. Walter G. Maddock, Associate Professor of
Surgery in the Department of Surgery and in the Department of
Postgraduate Medicine, Medical School, was accepted with sincere
regret, as of February 1, 1946. Dr. Maddock has accepted a position
in the Medical School of Northwestern University (p. 79).
G. Howard Gowen, M.D., Professorial Lecturer in Epidemiology,
School of Public Health, resigned his position as of February 11, 1946,
to accept an appointment as Chief of the Division of Cancer Control
with the Illinois State Department of Health. Dr. Gowen's resignation
was accepted with sincere regret (p. 216).
Routine appointments, all within the budget, were approved as
follows (p. 227):

WHEREAS, City Bank Farmers Trust Company and Clair B. Hughes, as
trustees, have presented an account dated June 30, 1945, of their proceedings as
trustees of the trust created under Clause Tenth of the last will and testament
of William W. Cook, deceased, for the benefit of the Law School of the University of Michigan; and
WHEREAS, In order to save the expense of a judicial settlement of said account, it is desirable to settle the said account out of court; and
WHEREAS, City Bank Farmers Trust Company and Clair B. Hughes, as
trustees, are willing to have their account settled out of court upon the terms and
conditions set forth in a certain instrument annexed to the said account whereby
the Regents of the University of Michigan. accept the said account as an account
stated, final and conclusive and release and discharge the said trustees, all as
more fully set forth in the said instrument; and
\VHEREAS, Said account has been duly examined by this Board and has been
found to be correct and true; be it therefore
Resolved, That said account of City Bank Farmers Trust Company and of
Clair B. Hughes as trustees covering the period from June 30, 1944, to and including June 30, 1945, be and is hereby approved in all respects and be it further
Resolved, That this corporation does hereby accept the said account as an
account stated final and conclusive and does hereby authorize and direct Alexander
G. Ruthven, President of this corporation, and Herbert G. Watkins, Secretary of
this corporation, to execute for and in the name of this corporation and under
its corporate seal an instrument substantially in the form annexed to the said




256


SECOND FEBRUARY MEETING, 1946


account releasing and discharging the said trustees as in said instrument more
fully set forth.
At the meeting of the Regents on July 17, 1942 (R.P., 1942-45.
p. 24), the following action was taken:
"The Board voted that 50 per cent of the interest collected on
student loans should hereafter, until further action, be set aside in
the reserve for uncollectible loans." It was felt at the time that war
casualties might cause a serious depletion in the loan funds, and that
the reserve for uncollectible loans might not be sufficient to take care
of the probable loss (R.P., 1926-29, p. 583). It is now apparent that
this addition to the reserve fund is not needed, and, on recommendation of the Cashier and the Vice-President in charge of business and
finance, the above quoted action was rescinded.
On recommendation by the Chicago Association of University of
Michigan Alumnae, the Regents approved that the current balance
of $493.64, now appearing in the expendable fund of the Chicago

increase  in  construction  estimates between   November, 1945, and
March 15, 1946, of $611,000. The Board endorsed the revised program, showing estimated increased cost over the original estimate, by
the adoption of the following resolution:
WHEREAS, The Regents at their meeting on November 30, 1945 (p. 169),
approved by resolution a cost plus fixed fee managerial contract with the George A.

$115,000 the following buildings, a Married Students' Dormitory, a Men's Dormitory, a Food Service Building, and a Women's Dormitory, and
WHEREAS, It now appears that the construction cost for the four buildings
indicated above will be substantially larger than the estimates as of November.
1945, that the said construction costs plus the contractor's fee are now estimated
to total $4,980,000, and that all costs, including architects' fees, land and land
acquisition costs, contingencies, and furnishings and equipment for these four
buildings will total approximately $6,216,857; therefore be it
Resolved, That the Regents recognize and approve the revision of the cost
of the program upwards and endorse its continuation on this basis.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance advised the
Regents that the Walling property on the site of the proposed Food
Service Building had been purchased at a cost of $11,100, thus avoiding the necessity of a condemnation suit.
Following a discussion of the educational building program, the
following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Vice-President in charge of business and finance is
directed to proceed with the educational building program listed below under the
assumption that $8,050,000 will be the sum available, and that this sum is to be

$8,050,000
Be it further, Resolved, That the executive officers be directed to work out
improvising methods which will establish a maximum of educational facilities
at the earliest possible moment and which will effect all possible savings so that
expenditures will not exceed the anticipated total of $8,050,000.

SPECIAL MARCH MJEETING, 1946


It is understood that the executive officers are instructed, under the
terms of this resolution, to consider especially the estimated cost of
the addition to the Chemistry Building to the end that the ultimate
cost of this building and its equipment may, if possible, be decreased,
provided such decrease in cost will not detract from its present and
future usefulness and the requirements of that department. Further,
all other buildings here scheduled for construction are to assume their
proper importance as to construction and furnishing within the limits
indicated.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to complete the negotiations for a cost plus a fixed fee managerial
contract with Bryant and Detwiler Company, Detroit, at an estimated
cost of $5,000,000 and a fee of $112,500, for the construction of the
General Service Building, the addition to the Chemistry Building, the
addition to the Engineering Building for electrical and aeronautical
engineering, and the School of Business Administration Building. The
President, or the Provost, and the Vice-President in charge of business
and finance, or the Secretary, were authorized to sign a letter of intent with Bryant and Detwiler Company to implement this contract.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance presented a
list of all those properties on the site of the proposed Business Administration Building, indicating the appraised values as of March, 1946,
with the exception of two parcels which have already been purchased
at the appraised value of June, 1945. The Board was advised that Mr.
Louis C. Andrews and Mr. Edward Couper, both of Ann Arbor, have
been authorized to negotiate with the property owners for the procurement of their property at the appraised values, in the hope that
all of these properties may be purchased without condemnation, provided, however, that if any properties cannot be purchased at the
appraised value, or at fair negotiated figures, the Regents will be requested at the meeting on March 29 to authorize the condemnation of
such properties. Messrs. Andrews and Couper are to be compensated
on the basis of $2,200 each for negotiating these sales, if possible, to
the University, together with two properties needed for the addition
to the East Engineering Building.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the Vice-President in charge of business and finance is directed

other departments.
The Board approved the recommendation of the Vice-President in
charge of business and finance that Eber White Woods in its entirety
be offered to the Ann Arbor Board of Education and that the offer to

further representation relating to its report. The Senate Advisory
Committee presented a statement to the Board at its meeting on February 22 (p. 256). In recognition of the matters laid before the Board
in the Report on Economic Status of the Faculty by the Senate Committee on University Affairs and of the recommendations by the
executive officers of the University in their report on this subject, the
following resolutions were adopted:
1. Resolved, That it is the purpose of the Regents of the University of
Michigan to maintain the educational accomplishments of the University at the
highest possible level so that they may be eminently worthy of the young men
and women who avail themselves of its educational opportunities, of the State
of Michigan in whose name it operates, and of the great social ends for which
it. exists, and
Further, that for the fulfillment of this purpose, the Regents realize that it
must depend primarily upon the high professional and personal qualifications of
the members of the faculties of the schools and colleges of the University. It is,
therefore, its purpose to attract to and retain in these faculties persons of the
highest competence, to provide them with adequate facilities for their work, and
to maintain an adequate scale of compensation for their services. It is also its
intention to make every reasonable effort to seek the financial support which will
make it possible to give continuing effect to this purpose, and
Further, that it is the intention of the Regents that the salary budget of the
University shall be so administered that especially effective service, in teaching,
in research, and in public affairs, distinctive achievement, and marked professional
growth and development shall be adequately rewarded by appropriate promotions
in academic grade and by increases in salary. To this end it expressly charges
the officers of the University, the President and Provost, the deans and directors
and executive committees of schools and colleges and other teaching and research
units, and the chairmen of departments of instruction, with the important responsibility for continuous review and evaluation of the services of members of the
teaching and research staff within their respective jurisdictions, and for recommendations regarding promotion and salaries which will reflect the purposes here
set forth.
2. Resolved, That the Regents hereby establishes the minimum salary of the
regular full-time instructor in the University at the sum of $2,500 for the University year, effective as soon as practicable. This regulation shall not relate to
instructors whose work is of such a nature that it does not ordinarily lead to
promotion through the academic ranks, nor shall it include persons who hold the
title of instructor while engaged in formal programs of professional training.
3. Resolved, That the Regents hereby directs the executive officers of the
University to undertake, in consultation with the representatives of the schools
and colleges and of the Senate, a further study of the proposal that members of
the faculty with exceptional distinction in any field be recognized by appointment
to special professorships carrying salaries in excess of the normal maximum in the




266


SECOND MARCH MEETING, 1946


fields which they represent, and to report recommendations to the Board of Regents for consideration.
4. Resolved, That the Regents hereby indicates interest in a continuing study
of the faculty salary scale and suggests that such a study be pursued by the
executive officers of the University, in consultation with the representatives of the
schools and colleges and of the Senate.
5. Resolved, That salaries in all administrative positions shall be graded
according to the responsibility involved; and
Further, that an incumbent of an administrative position, upon relinquishing
such position and returning to a full-time teaching or research assignment, shall
receive a salary commensurate with his qualifications and the value of his service
in the assignment upon which he will be engaged.

SECOND MARCH MEETING, 1946


267


March 12, 1946
The committee approved the request of Dean Ivan C. Crawford that he be
authorized to negotiate for a successor to Professor Arthur J. Decker, retired
(p. 226), of the Department of Civil Engineering, to begin with the spring term
of 1945-46, if possible, with a contemplated salary of from $3,500 to $4,000 for
the University year. It is understood that Dean Crawford, if and when a replacement can be made, will request the Regents for the necessary budget appropriation
for the salary required.
The committee gave approval to the request of Dean Crawford that Leo
L. Carrick, Professor of Chemical Engineering, and David W. Monroe, Assistant
Professor of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, be allowed to teach full
time for the spring term of 1945-46, instead of half time as previously appointed.
It is understood that no addition to the budget is necessitated by this action.
The committee approved the use of the unexpended portion $1,140 of the
salary of Associate Professor Harlow J. Heneman, resigned (p. 245), for use as
compensation for teaching assistants in the Department of Political Science, for
the spring term of 1945-46.
March 19, 1946
The committee appropriated the sum of $500 for current expenses to June 30,
1946, which presumably may be incurred by the committee appointed in connection with the work of the Joseph Ralston Hayden Memorial Library (p. 58).
The sum of $540 was appropriated as an addition to the salary account of the
Law Library to provide for additional assistance on Sunday afternoons and
evenings until June 30, 1946, made necessary by the demand for study hall facilities by the increased number of students using that Library. Permission was also
given to pay full-time employees on an overtime basis for work on Sunday.
The sum of $420.60 was added to the salary budget of the Department of
Ophthalmology, Medical School, to provide compensation to June 30, 1946, at the

Committee of the Institute of Public Administration for the remainder
of the present University year (p. 258). The salary of Assistant Professor John A. Perkins, Secretary of the Executive Committee, was

The Regents at their meeting on January 4, 1946, instructed the
Committee on University Fees to undertake a new study of fees, having in mind (1) the desirability of making them more nearly relative
to cost of education, (2) the reciprocal advantages offered by other
state universities to Michigan residents, (3) the resources and obligations of certain schools and colleges within the University, and (4) the
importance of maintaining the national character of this institution
(p. 192 and R.P., 1942-45, p. 933).

SECOND MARCH MEETING, 1946


The Board received the report of the Committee on Fees and
approved the recommended fees schedule amended as follows:
a) The nonresident fees for full-time work in the several units which were
recommended to be $140 a semester are to be $150 a semester.
b) The nonresident fee for full-time work in the Law School which was recommended to be $160 a semester is to be $175 a semester.
c) Such other amendments to be included as may be deemed by the Committee on Fees as compatible with the amendments made in (a) and (b).
The fee schedule as approved appears as an appendix to this meeting,
effective with the University year 1946-47.
On recommendation by the Executive Committee of the Summer
Session, the Board established the following salary scale for the regular
eight-week summer employment of the faculty to become effective
with the Summer Session of 1946.
Academic Year Salaries              Summer Salaries
$2,500 or less                    25%  of the academic salary
Between $2,500 and $5,000         15%  of the academic salary plus $250
Between $5,000 and $7,000          5%  of the academic salary plus $750
Above    $7,000                   $1,100
This action, it is understood, allows the Director of the Summer
Session to provide (1) a further allowance of from         $100 to $200 to
cover transportation costs and other expenses to distinguished visiting
members of the summer faculty, (2) compensations for longer periods
than  the regular eight weeks of the session         computed   proportionately, and (3) compensation for intensive programs of six weeks
set at 80 per cent of the eight-week stipends.
On recommendation by Dr. Frank E. Robbins, the Regents prescribed the following conditions of awards for three scholarships provided under the terms of the will of the late Bryant Walker of Detroit
(R.P., 1936-39, p. 251):
The Jessie W. Radcliff Scholarship (principal sum, $2,500): In accordance with
the will, this is to be a postgraduate scholarship for women in the Medical
School who are preparing to go out as medical missionaries, with preference
to be given those of the Presbyterian denomination. It is recommended that
the faculty of the Medical School, through its Scholarship Committee, shall
designate the holders of this scholarship. In order that the income of the
fund may provide a suitable stipend, appointments may be omitted in certain
years to permit the accumulation of expendable funds.
The Edward C. Walker Scholarship (principal sum, $2,500): The will prescribes
that the income of this fund is to be used for postgraduate scholarships under
the direction of the Museum of Zoology for excellence in biology. It is recommended that appointments to this scholarship be made by the Executive
Board of the Graduate School on recommendation of the Executive Committee
of the Museum of Zoology. In order that the income of the fund may provide
a suitable stipend, appointments may be omitted in certain years to permit
the accumulation of expendable funds.
The Mary McGuire Walker Scholarship (principal sum, $2,500): This is to be
used for postgraduate scholarships for women for excellence in English literature. It is recommended that appointments be made by the Executive
Board of the Graduate School on recommendation of the Department of
English Language and Literature. In order that the income of the fund may
provide a suitable stipend, appointments may be omitted in certain years to
permit the accumulation of expendable funds.
On recommendation by the Finance Committee, the following statement of investment policy of the University was approved:
In order to carry out the wishes of the donors of endowment funds, due
regard shall be given to the production of income from investments as well as to




SECOND MARCH MEETING, 1946


299


the conservation of the principal of the funds. The investment policy of the
University shall be based on the principle of a broad diversification among various fields of investments and among various securities within these fields.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That no legal action before a court or administrative tribunal be
instituted in the name of The Regents by any employee of the University except
by permission of this Board.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance was authorized to negotiate a contract with Mr. F. Huston Colvin for his services
in connection with the architectural plans for the proposed remodeling
of the Mary Bartron Henderson Memorial House (pp. 60 and 55).
The employment status of Hanns Pick was changed from fourteen
twenty-fifths-time to eighteen twenty-fifths-time Professor of Violoncello, School of Music, for the spring term of 1945-46 only, with
compensation of $2,250 for the period. No addition to the budget is
necessitated by this action.
Jackson Edward O'Connell, Lt.(jg), U.S.N.R., was appointed Assistant Professor of Naval Science and Tactics from February 28, 1946,
until detached by the Navy Department, vice Lt. Thomas F. O'Loughlin,
Jr., resigned February 23. No salary payable by the University is
necessary because of this appointment.

8, 1946. Edward John Kmet, C.B.M., U.S. Navy, was appointed
Assistant in the Department of Naval Science and Tactics beginning
March 5, 1946. Both of these appointments are to continue until the
appointees are detached by the United States Navy Department, and
no salaries payable by the University are involved.
Joseph T. Gregory, Ph.D., returned from war leave (R.P., 1942-45,
p. 957), was appointed Half-time Instructor in the Department of
Geology, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts and Curator of
Vertebrates in the Museum of Paleontology, both appointments to
begin April 1, 1946, with total compensation of $2,800 for the University year, payable one-half from the salary budget of the Department of
Geology, to which budget $523.42 was added to provide compensation
for the remainder of the present University year and a like amount
was added to the salarybudget of the Museum of Paleontology for a
similar purpose.
Jack Matthews Farris, M.D., was appointed Assistant Professor of
Surgery, Medical School, from February 1 to June 30, 1946, with
compensation at the rate of $6,000 a year, twelve-month basis, payable from the salary originally allocated as compensation for Dr.
Walter G. Maddock, resigned (p. 245), at the rate of $5,000 from the
salary budget of the Department of Surgery and $1,000 from the
budget of University Hospital.
The traveling expense vouchers of Regent Herbert were approved
in the total of $164.58 to cover attendance at the meetings of the
Regents on February 1 and February 22, 1946.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote.
The Board adjourned to meet on April 26, 1946, at 2:00 P.M.

the wives or minor children of such aliens, who have otherwise met
these requirements for residence, are regarded as eligible for registration as residents of Michigan.
8. Discretion to adjust individual cases within the spirit of these
rules is lodged with the Secretary of the University, with the right of
appeal to the Regents.
PENALTY FOR IMPROPER REGISTRATION AS A
MICHIGAN RESIDENT
The fees for students from Michigan are lower, with obvious
propriety, than those for students from other states and countries. Thus
it is necessary that residence be properly determined at the time of
registration. The Regents have, therefore, adopted the following resolutions providing for a penalty for improper registration as a Michigan resident:
WHEREAS, The state of Michigan in a liberal and generous spirit
extends the privileges of the University of Michigan to students from
other states and countries at but moderate advance in fees above fees
charged residents of Michigan; and
WHEREAS, It happens from time to time that persons not legally
resident in Michigan attempt to take advantage of the University by
registering from Michigan in order to save the small difference in fees;
Therefore, be it Resolved, That hereafter the burden of registering
under proper residence shall be placed upon the student; and it shall
be the duty of each student at registration, if there be any possible
question of right to legal residence in Michigan under the rules of the
Regents, to raise the question with the registration officer and have
such question settled by the proper officers of the University, previous
to registration. Any student who registers improperly under this rule
shall, when discovered, be required to pay not only the proper nonresident fees, but shall be assessed, as an addition to the fee for that
semester, the sum of $10.
Resolved, further, That before any student's registration is accepted by the departmental registration officer, such officer shall place
in the hands of the prospective student a copy of this legislation and
also of the Regents' rules with respect to the determination of
residence.

REGULATIONS GOVERNING HEALTH SERVICE
PRIVILEGES
1. Treatment by the Health Service of those students entitled to
that service is optional on their part, except when in the opinion of the
Director they may be a source of danger to student health. The type
and amount of service rendered shall be in conformity with the rules
and regulations of the Health Service.
2. Students who wish to enroll for the first time, to re-enroll
after an absence of a full semester, or who are specifically listed for
approval, must obtain Health Service approval as part of registration.
Such approval is to be based upon assurance of health safety to the
entrant and associates as determined by a suitable examination and
evidence of vaccination (immunity to smallpox). Vaccination may be
waived by the Director of the Health Service for applicants who file
statements of objection on religious grounds properly signed, in case
of minors, by parents or guardians. Such waiver shall release the University from the responsibility of financial assistance to the applicant
who contracts smallpox.
3. For a statement of other rules and regulations, see the Director of the Health Service.

All members of the Board were present with the exception of the
President and Superintendent of Public Instruction Elliott. There were
also in attendance the Provost, Vice-President Briggs, Dr. F. E.
Robbins, and the Secretary. Vice-President Niehuss was also absent.
The Provost presided.
The usual financial reports were placed on file.
The Vice-President in charge of business and finance filed a report
of progress made on plant extension since the meeting of the Regents
on March 29 (p. 263).
The minutes of the meeting of March 29 were approved as submitted to the members in press proof, with certain specified changes.
On recommendation by the Finance Committee, the following resolution was adopted:
WHEREAS, The Regents of the University of Michigan at its meeting on January 23, 1931, (R.P., 1929-32, p. 540) authorized and adopted "A Plan to Supplement Incomes Provided by the Carnegie Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation," according to the terms of which the University was obligated to make, and
has made, segregated and set aside the supplementary payments required by such
plan, as more fully defined in said plan, to which reference is hereby made; and
WHEREAS, The total of said supplementary payments now segregated and set
aside, and reserved for the purpose of said plan total the sum of $589,328.55,
Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, That said funds, together with any accretions
thereof and additions and supplementations thereto, be and the same hereby are
declared to constitute a Trust Fund denominated as "Older Faculty Supplementary
Annuity Fund," to be devoted solely to the carrying out of the said plan, and are
to be held inviolate for such purposes. Provided, however, that as to the management, investment and reinvestment thereof, the authority and discretion of The
Regents of the University of Michigan as to the care and management of funds
under its direction and control shall not be curtailed or limited by these presents.
On recommendation by the Conference of Deans and the University Committee on Fees, the following requirements were approved to
be imposed upon all prospective students who have otherwise been
approved for admission to their respective units for the first time
during the University year 1946-47:
1. A deposit of $25 must be paid before the acceptance of an academically
eligible candidate becomes final. This deposit must be paid by persons previously
determined to be eligible but not hitherto registered in the University in order
that they may retain their applications in good standing. The acceptance deposit
is payable to the University within three weeks of the date of the notice of final
acceptance (or, in case of those already notified, within three weeks of the date
of the communication requesting payment). The payment shall be evidenced by
a receipt to be mailed to the applicant. At the time of first registration, upon
presentation of the receipt, the deposit will be credited toward the semester fee,
or for veterans whose fee is paid by the United States Government, and for persons who hold tuition.scholarships, the sum will be refunded. If the applicant
does not register at the time stipulated in the admission papers, the deposit will
be forfeited, except in case registration is prevented by illness, draft call, or other
cause deemed adequate by the proper administrative authorities. The several admissions officers may waive the acceptance deposit requirement for foreign students and for admission to institutes or other short courses, and in other instances
in which it is impracticable or inexpedient to impose the deposit.

APRIL MEETING, 1946


2. Applications for admission to the first semester, 1946, must be presented
on or before August 1, and applications for admission to the second semester,

fixed by the administrative authorities of any school or college) provided, however,
that veterans discharged after that date may be accepted if their applications are
filed within a reasonable time after discharge, and provided further that the several admissions officers may accept late applications from other persons if good
cause is shown for the delay in filing.
The Board received and placed on file the report of Professor
Herbert O. Crisler as Chairman of the Board in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics for the year ended June 30, 1945 (R.P., 1942-45,
p. 892). This report supplements and amplifies in some respects the
report of the auditors submitted to the Regents on November 3, 1945
(pp. 162 and 122).
The Board accepted, with sincere thanks and under the terms and
conditions stipulated by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation in its letter

the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to finance a program for a period of
three years with an annual contribution of $35,000 for "a decentralized plan of graduate medical education." This proposal, introduced at
the meeting of the Regents on March 29 (p. 266), was referred to the
Provost and Vice-President Niehuss for consideration and report, and
it is on their recommendation and on the hearty approval of the Board
that the proposal was accepted.

total of $11,853,000 (exclusive of the University Hospital), with a
suitable margin for contingencies. The total here shown indicates a
deficit of $1,146,000.
The Board referred to the President for consideration and report

The sum of $350 was appropriated as an addition to the current account of
the College of Pharmacy for certain furniture repairs in space occupied by the
College of Pharmacy in the Chemistry Building.
Approval was given for the use of $900, which appears as unused in the

granted to Professor A. J. Eardley (p. 159), for assistants in the Department during the spring term of 1945-46.
The committee approved the appointment of Robert W. Parry, M.S., as Instructor in Chemistry for the University year 1946-47, with compensation at the rate

The Secretary reported for record the following paragraph from
the will of the late Charles Hunt Garrison, under the terms of which
the University is at present a contingent beneficiary:
4. At the death of the survivor of Ada Stebbins, Frances Stebbins, and Mrs.
Aleyne G. Wilson, the Trustees shall assign, transfer, convey and pay over the
entire remainder of the body or corpus of the trust property and estate, free and
discharged from the trusts hereof, to the Board of Regents of the University of
Michigan, to be used by said Board as a student loan fund and to be known as
the Charles Hunt Garrison Student Loan fund. I make no restrictions on the use
of the fund by the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan for the reason
that I have full confidence that it will be used by them in cases found to be
worthy.
The Secretary reported that, according to the attorneys who are
administering the will of the late Alfred B. Jenkins of West Orange,
New Jersey (R.P., 1914-17, p. 746), there now seems little probability
that the Regents will ever benefit from the proceeds of that bequest.
According to the attorneys, "under the circumstances we think it is
unlikely that your university will share in the residue of the estate."
The President reported the following gifts, which were accepted in
accordance with their terms and conditions and with appropriate
thanks in each case (p. 268):

The following proposal from Mr. S. Spencer Scott, Pharm., '14, of
New York City, was accepted, with sincere thanks and under the conditions here indicated:
This Agreement entered into this 15th day of April, 1946, by and between
S. Spencer Scott, of Scarsdale, New York, hereinafter called Donor, and The
Regents of the University of Michigan, of Ann Arbor, Michigan, hereinafter called
Donee:
Donor does hereby give, grant, set over and deliver to Donee Series "F" War
Savings Bonds issued by the United States of America under date of November,
1945, having a total maturity value of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), issued
in the name of Donee as owner, and paid for by Donor, which gift is made subject
to the following conditions, which conditions are hereby assented to by Donee on
behalf of itself, its successors and assigns:
(1) Donee shall collect the principal of said bonds when they mature, and
shall invest and reinvest said principal sum from time to time in such manner
as Donee, in its discretion, may deem advisable.
(2) Donee shall, after said bonds mature, use the income from said principal
sum, as so invested or reinvested, for the purpose of making an award of medals
or other suitable tokens each year to not less than three or more than nine
alumni of the University of Michigan who are designated for such year by the
Alumni Association of the University of Michigan (or by any successor organization which at the time is performing the same general functions) as especially
deserving of recognition by reason of services performed for the benefit of the
University of Michigan or in connection with its organized alumni activities.
(3) Donee agrees that for the purpose of designating the fund it is to be
known as the S. Spencer Scott Alumni Award Fund.
As the bonds will not mature until 1957, it is understood that Mr.
Scott will, in the interim, make annual gifts to the University so that
the project may be effective at once. At a subsequent meeting of the
Board, the Provost and the Vice-President in charge of University

relations will indicate the procedure by which this proposal will be
implemented.
As part of the ten-year program of the University of Michigan
Club of Detroit, the following tuition scholarship was established in
the amount of $130 a year, under the terms and conditions specified
by Mr. Dexter M. Ferry, Jr., to whom the Regents extend their
grateful appreciation:
D. M. Ferry, Jr., Tuition Scholarship of the University of Michigan Club of
Detroit. Appointments of the beneficiary of this scholarship are to be made for
one year but may be renewed if in the opinion of the administrating officer of
the University the recipient's record has been so meritorious as to justify reappointment and providing funds are available.
I direct that recipients be named from recommendees offered by the Scholarship Committee of the University of Michigan Club of Detroit. Awards will be
made on the basis of (A) moral character and good citizenship, (B) scholastic
ability and intellectual capacity and achievement, (C) physical ability, vigor and
vitality, and (D) capacity and performance of leadership and success.
Aside from the restrictions hereinbefore imposed, I respectfully request your
Honorable Board to hold, administer and expend all gifts made to this fund in
accordance with your regular practices in such cases. These funds are expendable
and shall not constitute an endowment.

APRIL MEETING, 1946

On recommendation by the Committee on Budget Administration,
the following members of the faculty were granted permission to subscribe to annuity contracts with the. Teachers Insurance and Annuity
Association as of May 1, 1946, on the basis of a matched contribution
by the individual and the University (5 per cent and 5 per cent alike)
to a maximum of $250 on the part of the University. It is distinctly
understood that this privilege carries no responsibility on the part of
the University to provide funds for annuity premiums for the time
lost by each individual by reason of his failure to subscribe to an
annuity policy when the opportunity was first presented. Neither is
there any presumption that these policies are to bear more than a
5 per cent contribution rate by the University, although all policies
contracted for since January 1, 1939, provide for a 10 per cent contribution. This privilege is granted at this time because each of those
mentioned below signed a waiver, under the terms of which his rights
to subscribe to the annuity policy were forfeited. Subsequently, however, at their request, permission is now given to subscribe at this
time:
Department
Edward L. Eriksen                 Engineering Mechanics
Alfred L. Ferguson                 Chemistry
Holger M. Hansen                  Engineering Mechanics

The following amendment of Section 16.05 of the Bylaws was approved (p. 258):
Section 16.05. Institute of Public Administration. The Institute of Public
Administration shall be maintained for the purpose of promoting and conducting
instruction, research, and service in governmental fields requiring technical knowledge and skills based upon the social sciences and related disciplines. The Institute shall co-ordinate the curricular offerings of the several schools and colleges
to the end that students may gain a more adequate understanding of the nature
and function of government and thereby become better equipped to serve in governmental capacities.
The Institute shall be in the immediate charge of an Executive Committee.
The Executive Committee shall consist of the Dean of the Graduate School, the
Dean of the Law School, the Dean of the School of Business Administration, the
Chairman of the Department of Economics, and the Chairman of the Department
of Political Science; each of the above-mentioned officers to be authorized to
designate a representative to serve on the committee, with the understanding that
such representative shall have full power to act for the principal and that each
such representative shall be designated for a period of not less than two years.
The Chairman of the Executive Committee shall be designated by the Board of
Regents on recommendation by the President.
Whenever the Executive Committee has under consideration matters related
to the interest and participation in the Institute of a teaching or research unit
not represented on the Executive Committee, the responsible representative of
such unit shall be invited to participate in such consideration.
The Executive Committee shall be responsible to the general administration
of the University with respect to appointments, budget, and the organization and
conduct of the program. The Institute shall operate through the existing schools
and colleges in matters related to the formulation of teaching programs and the
fulfillment of the requirements for degrees.
A secretary of the Executive Committee shall be appointed by the Board of
Regents on recommendation by the President and the Executive Committee. The
secretary shall be responsible to the Executive Committee for the administrative
duties arising in connection with the Institute.




326


APRIL MEETING, 1946


The Institute shall co-ordinate the teaching interests and efforts of the several units on the campus that contribute to the work of the Institute.    All
members of the University staff participating in Institute instruction programs,
including the secretary and other persons who may be appointed in teaching
capacities to serve the Institute, shall hold teaching appointments in one of the
established teaching units, and all courses in such programs shall be offered in
such units.
The Institute shall, in co-operation with the appropriate authorities of existing schools and colleges, formulate undergraduate concentration and graduate
study programs.
The Bureau of Government shall be a subdivision of the Institute and shall
be responsible to the Executive Committee. The Bureau shall be operated as a
research and service agency of the Institute.
The Board authorized the proper executive officers to sign necessary agreements with the Detroit Edison Company to effect certain
changes in the electrical installation of that corporation as follows:
1. Food Service Building Area: Moving the existing underground work to the
opposite side of the University railroad spur between Ann and Huron streets.
2. Corner of Huron Street and Forest Avenue: Moving approximately thirtyfive feet of underground work now on University property.
3. Women's Residence Halls: The present overhead lines to be placed underground with University lines starting approximately at the corner of Forest Avenue and Huron Street across University property to Observatory Street to avoid
the new dormitory as well as Mosher-Jordan Halls. In this case the University
is to construct nine four-inch ducts, three of which are for the use of the Detroit
Edison Company and six for the use of the University, toward which the Detroit
Edison Company is to pay one-third of the cost, for which consideration rental
will be charged after twenty years at $250 a year.
On recommendation by Dr. Albert C. Kerlikowske and the Board
in Control of the University. Hospital, the ward and room rates in
the University Hospital were increased as of May 1, 1946, together
with upward adjustments in all commodity prices and miscellaneous
charges to be effective July 1, 1946. This action is necessary because
of a contemplated operating deficit of approximately $170,000 for the
fiscal year 1945-46. It is hoped that these increases will provide funds
for the balancing of the budget for the next fiscal year.
The Library Binding Association with an annual fee of $10 was
added to the list of organizations to which the University pays dues
(R.P., 1942-45, p. 689).
Section 3.01 of the Bylaws was amended to read as follows:
Chapter III. BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, FINANCES,
AND PROPERTY
Sec. 3.01. The Vice-President in charge of business and finance. The vicepresident in charge of business and finance shall, except as otherwise specifically

(5) He shall have general supervision of and responsibility for proper management of all operating funds containing working capital for the conduct of the

(9) He shall prepare and deliver periodically to each member of the Board
of Regents a brief statement showing under general heads the receipts and disbursements during the preceding period or since the last preceding report was

(By-Laws, 1923, Chap. II, Sec. 3 (e) and 4 (e) and (I); and R.P., 1920-23,
p. 784, and 1926-29, p. 311.)
Section 3.05 of the Bylaws was amended to read as follows:
Sec. 3.05. Nonacademic Personnel Administration. Responsibility for the administration of personnel and employee relations policies and procedures related
to nonacademic and nonadministrative personnel, which shall be defined to include
such categories as technicians, clinicians, chemists, pharmacists, nurses, social
workers, dietitians, therapists, engineers, skilled and unskilled workers, plant
service employees, clerical and fiscal personnel, and such other nonacademic classifications as may be included from time to time by agreement of the proper administrative authorities, is assigned to the vice-president in charge of business and
finance. He shall administer such rules, regulations, and procedures pertaining to
the classification, evaluation, employment, absences, sick leave, vacations, and
terminations of employment relating to such employees as may be established from
time to time by the Board of Regents. He shall also be responsible for the maintenance of personnel records related to such employees and shall give consideration
to prospective transfers from one position to another when such transfers will
represent an advancement for the person in question and at the same time will
serve the best interest of the University.
The Regents adopted the following rules and regulations relating to
sick leave for nonacademic employees to implement the provisions of
Section 3.05 of the Bylaws as approved above:
Sick Leave For Nonacademic Employees. A nonacademic employee in any
unit of the University shall be granted sick leave for disability resulting from
sickness or from accidents not incurred in the actual performance of an employ



328


APRIL MEETING, 1946


ee's occupation. He shall be entitled to sick leave beginning with the first day
of disability in accordance with the policy set forth below:
(1) Every continuing, full-time employee shall be entitled to sick leave with
pay of one working day for each complete month of service.
(2) Unused sick leave may be accumulated up to one hundred working days.
(3) An employee may utilize his sick leave allowance upon approval of the
administrative head andt the Personnel Office, for absences due to illness,
injury, or exposure to contagious diseases endangering the health of other
employees, and to illness or death in the employee's immediate family.
(4) In case of disability directly or indirectly arising out of the use of
intoxicants or immoral or disorderly conduct, no right to sick leave benefits under this policy shall exist.
(5) An employee is not entitled to benefits under this policy unless satisfactory evidence of physical disability to work by reason of accident or
sickness is furnished. In all cases the employee must notify his department head. The Personnel Office and/or the administrative head may
require the employee to furnish a sworn affidavit to the effect that his
absence was caused by illness. The University reserves the right to have
a doctor or nurse employed by or approved by the University make
such examinations from time to time as may be necessary to ascertain the
employee's condition. To qualify for sick leave, a disabled employee is
expected to take care of himself and when necessary, at his own expense,
to obtain the services of a qualified physician.
(6) The continuous service record of an employee who has been employed by
any unit of the University without interruption shall be calculated from
the date of original employment.
Voluntary termination or discharge shall be considered a complete break
in service continuity and no past service will be credited in case of
re-employment.
(7) The accumulated sick leave as of July 1, 1946, shall consist of one
day for each full month of service during the preceding twelve-month
period less any sick leave granted during that period. For purposes of
determining the amount of sick leave under this policy, the University records concerning an employee's length of service, his continuity of service,
and his days of absence because of sickness or nonoccupational disability
shall be accepted.
(8) The transfer of an employee from one University unit to another shall
not affect his sick leave status in any respect.
(9) The University reserves the right to withdraw or modify the policy at
any time. However, when a disability occurs, the University will allow
sick leave in accordance with the provisions and conditions of this policy
as it is in effect at the time the disability occurs.
The Board approved the following rules and regulations governing
vacation and terminal allowances for nonacademic employees to give
effect to revisions of Section 3.05 of the Bylaws as amended at this
meeting (p. 328):
Vacation and Terminal Allowances for Nonacademic Employees. A full time,
nonacademic salaried employee of the University of Michigan shall be granted
an annual vacation in accordance with the policy set forth below:
(1) The annual vacation allowance shall be accrued on the basis of two
work days per month for each full calendar month of service with additional credit of one work day at the end of twelve consecutive months
of service. (Maximum vacation allowance per year, 25 work days.)
(2) The vacation accrual period shall be the fiscal year July 1 to June 30.
A vacation allowance accrued to June 30 shall be taken during the
twelve months following the vacation accrual period, provided that if it
serves the mutual convenience of the University and employee, a part of
such vacation may be taken after January 1 of the year in which it
accrues. Vacations earned during the vacation accrual periods must be
taken within the twelve months following the accrual period or forfeited
unless arrangement is made for compensation in lieu of vacation as set
forth in (3) below.
(3) Compensation in lieu of vacation may be granted when the urgency of
University activities provides extenuating circumstances under which an




APRIL MEETING, 1946                            329
employee is not permitted a vacation by the end of the. twelve-month
period following the vacation accrual period. The employee may receive,
upon recommendation of the affected administrative head and approval
of the vice-president in charge of business and finance or his designated
representative, the salary equivalent of the allowable vacation. Such
approval must be requested before the end of the twelve-month period
following the vacation accrual period for which payment is to be made.
(4) Vacations must be earned in accordance with Section (1) before they are
taken. Service of an employee shall not be anticipated by scheduling
vacations in advance of their being earned and in excess of the accrued
vacation allowance.
(5) In event of resignation, layoff, or discharge, a salaried employee who has
been employed six months or more shall receive, at the time of separation, the salary equivalent of any unused part of his accrued vacation
allowance at the rate prevailing on the effective separation date.
(6) Absences of one-half day or more for reasons other than illness shall be
deducted from the accrued vacation allowance. If there is insufficient vacation allowance to cover such absence, the excess shall be deducted from
compensation and will not be restored automatically at a later date in
lieu of vacation allowance.
(7) No vacation allowance shall accrue during a leave of absence either with
or without compensation.
(8) Sundays and holidays occurring during a vacation period shall not be
counted against the annual vacation allowance.
(9) An employee working on a half-time basis or more shall receive a proportionate vacation allowance:
(10) The transfer of an employee from one University unit to another shall
not affect his vacation status in any respect.
(11) Scheduling of vacations within the limits of the accrued vacation allowance shall be in accordance with the following:
(a) Vacations shall be scheduled to suit the work program of the
department
(b) Vacations may be divided into parts only at the discretion of
the department head.
(c) Vacations shall be scheduled so that an employee may receive the
equivalent of one year's vacation allowance at one time, and there
shall be a reasonable interval between the vacation period of one
year and that for the ensuing year.
(d) Insofar as possible, vacation periods shall be arranged to avoid
return to duty on Saturday morning.
(12) The vacation policy outlined above shall be observed by all nonacademic
salaried personnel of the University. In the event unusual operating conditions or emergencies make it difficult to adhere to the policy as set
forth, they shall be brought to the attention of the vice-president in
charge of business and finance, and permission secured before arrangements not in accordance with the policy are made.
On recommendation by Dr. Warner G. Rice, Director of the General Library, Professor A. E. R. Boak was appointed to a vacancy on

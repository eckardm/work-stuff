       President Coleman reported that the National Science Foundation (NSF)

selected Michigan as one of three universities in the country to train researchers in the
ways of entrepreneurship.

       President Coleman welcomed members of U-M Autonomy Team, winners of
the gold medal in the RoboBoat Competition, a race for unmanned robotic boats, with
their boat, named Serenity. This is the second time in four years that Michigan has
earned the gold medal. Three students who participated in the competition introduced
themselves: Nikki Kudzia, Raghav Ramkumar and Jakob Hollerbau.

       President Coleman introduced Professor George Alter, director of the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), which is part of the

data in the world. ISR is made up of five centers with over 20 disciplines. Professor
Alter described ongoing research projects, including studies of consumers sentiment,

University of Michigan faculty as a professor in 1986, and was named Arthur B.
Modine Professor of Engineering in 2008.
       Professor van Leer's early work arose from his interest in modeling
astrophysical flows. In a series of papers published in the 1970s, "Towards the
Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme," he laid out the methodology for creating
schemes that combined second-order accuracy and monotonicity, breaking a barrier
theorem due to S. K. Godunov. More recently, he has done influential research on
many aspects of computational fluid dynamics, which has led to greatly improved
accuracy and efficiency of methods. Professor van Leer's influence has also extended
to the teaching of computational fluid dynamics; the two-course graduate sequence he
instituted at the University was one of the first of its kind in the country.
       In recognition of his contributions to the field, Professor van Leer received an
honorary doctorate from the Vrije Universiteit Brussels in 1990 and was elected a fellow
of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) in 1995. In 2010, he

                                                               September 20, 2012

Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Harper,
Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President
Pescovitz, Vice President Rudgers, Interim Vice President Kowich, Executive Vice
President Slottow, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
        President Coleman called the meeting to order. She reported that she recently
had the opportunity to join the chancellor of UCLA and the president of the Carnegie
Foundation at the National Press Club in a conversation about the future of public
higher education and what is hoped of the next presidential administration.
       President Coleman said that she will lead a faculty delegation to Brazil to
expand the University's academic partnerships, and to meet with university, foundation
and government leaders in Sao Paulo, Brasilia, and Rio de Janeiro. International
collaborations such as those increase our understanding of the world and allow us to
better prepare tomorrow's global citizens.
Naming of the School of Art and Design in honor of Penny W. Stamps
       President Coleman commented on the many ways that the University and the
School of Art and Design have benefited from the generosity of Penny and Roe Stamps.
Penny, an alumna of the School of Art and Design, and her husband have endowed
scholarships, established a distinguished visitors program, and supported an art gallery,
among other programs. In honor of a $40 million commitment to the School of Art and
Design ($32.5 million from the Stamps family foundations and a match of $7.5 million
from the University), President Coleman said that she is excited to propose that the
school be named the Penny W. Stamps School of Art and Design.
       Provost Hanlon said, "This is a truly transformative gift, of great importance to
the School of Art and Design and to the University." He praised the school as a
nationally recognized innovator and leader in the academic conversation in art and
design, and said that the gift will provide the critical resources required for its
ambitious programs, while elevating awareness of art and design across campus and in
the community. Noting that current dean Gunalan Nadarajan and former dean Bryan
Rogers were in attendance at this meeting, he recognized their leadership in bringing
the school to this point.
        Dean Nadarajan thanked the Stamps for their gift, noting that "they are
amazing people with an incredible commitment to the school, to the future direction of
the school, and to their support of me in this role." Former dean Rogers also thanked


29



~


September Meeting, 2012


the Stamps for their generosity, and the regents and administration for their support
during his tenure. He noted that it is very unusual for a school of art and design to
receive such a donation.
         Regent Deitch added that "a venture philanthropist only supports a project
when it is backed by a management team he or she believes in," and thanked Dean
Rogers for his "vision, commitment, excitement, and ability to articulate the importance
of the visual arts that led to this gift," noting it would not have happened without his
leadership.
         Vice President May observed that the Stamps, who support the Stamps
Scholars Program at the University and similar merit programs at 25 other institutions
across the country, as well as The Fallen Heroes Fund, which serves veterans and their
families, "represent the best of American philanthropy." He thanked former dean
Rogers, President Coleman, Provost Hanlon, and Executive Vice President Slottow for
their contributions to this effort.
         On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Darlow, the regents
unanimously approved designating the School of Art and Design as the Penny W.
Stamps School of Art and Design.

         President Coleman then turned to the eight conflict of interest items each of
which requires six votes for approval, and which would be approved via a single

       President Coleman then said that there would be a presentation entitled:
 "MOOCs and More: UM's Participation in Coursera"
       Provost Hanlon, introduced Martha Pollack, vice provost for academic &
budgetary affairs, and Scott Page, Leonid Hurwicz Collegiate Professor of Political
Science, professor of Political Science, Professor of Economics, director, Study of
Complex Systems, LSA and research professor, Center for Political Studies, ISR.
       Provost Hanlon said that using the internet to deliver instruction is not new,
rather it is the way in which it is used that continues to evolve. This includes the
current, growing trend of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Coursera, one of
the first entities to enter this emerging field, began as a partnership with small group of
elite institutions, including UM, Stanford, Princeton, and the University of
Pennsylvania. All offered various courses available at no cost to students.
       Vice Provost Pollack continued, noting that Coursera currently has 33 partners,
all of whom offer free classes open to anyone around the world. Among the ways the
University may use Coursera are to enhance on campus learning for students, add more
engaging on-line offerings, increase interactive experiences, and as a platform for
delivering professional and continuing education programs for which fees are charged.
       Professor Page described his experience in teaching his "Model Thinking"
course, which has attracted tens of thousands of students world-wide.
       Among the reasons cited by Provost Pollack as to why the University is
engaging in this activity are that the world is heading in this direction and UM wants to
be a leader, it has the potential to expand the number of formats in which learning can
take place, it can further the University's public mission to share expertise, it can help
connect with alumni, prospective students and citizens, and it is a potential new
revenue stream.

September Meeting, 2012


       President Coleman then turned to the regular agenda.
Committee Reports
       Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, reported that she and Regent Richner met
with Executive Vice President Slottow and reviewed the 2012 external audit results,
along   with   external   auditors  Rick   Stover   and   Chris   Hoffman     from
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC). Also present were Rowan Miranda, associate vice
president for finance, Paul Castillo, chief financial officer, UM Health System, along
with Cheryl Soper, controller and director of financial operations, and Jeffrey Moelich,
executive director of university audits. The PWC auditors provided an unqualified
opinion. All Regents received the audited financials which will be presented for a vote
at the October Regent meeting. Regent White added that the committee had an
opportunity to meet in private with the auditors and was pleased to learn that no
concerns were raised.
       The committee also met with Provost Hanlon and Vice Provost Pollack and
reviewed non-traditional education programs for the potential expansion of spring and
summer instruction.
       Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor, chair
of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, reported that he and
Regents Newman and Ilitch met with Provost Hanlon for an update on searches, and
other issues. There was discussion of faculty perquisites and salaries, and the

Alliance. She added that a State of the Health System will be presented Vice President
Pescovitz on October 9, 2012.
President's Compensation
        Regent Taylor said that this is the time of year when the regents consider the
compensation of the president, using a due diligence process that includes viewing
various publications, benchmarks, and best practices. He said that while the regents
believe that "if anything the president's salary is too low," they considered tuition, state
funding, and the general condition of the state economy in making a salary
recommendation.
        Regent Taylor moved that President Coleman's base salary be increased by
three percent or $17,574, bringing her new base salary to $603,357. Regent White
seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

world to her. She announced that she is donating her salary increase to student study

had no additional report.
       Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper added that she is thrilled

improvements are focused on plumbing, bathroom fixtures, and outdated infrastructure.
       University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little added that one of the
long-term goals for the Dearborn campus was to establish housing for students. He said
that a privately developed, funded, and managed housing project will be opening a $30

September Meeting, 2012


       Jeffrey A. Alexander, Ph.D., Richard Carl Jelinek Professor of Health
Management and Policy and professor of health management and policy, School of
Public Health, professor of organizational behavior and human resource management,
Stephen M. Ross School of Business, and faculty associate, Survey Research Center,
Institute of Social Research, retired from active faculty status on July 31, 2012.
       Professor Alexander received his B.A. degree from the University of Texas in
1969, and his M.S., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University in 1976, 1978,
and 1980, respectively. He was a senior researcher and assistant director at the
Hospital Research and Educational Trust (1983-85), research associate at the Sisters of
Mercy Health Care Corporation (1984-86), and faculty member at the University of
Alabama (1986-88) before joining the University of Michigan School of Public Health
faculty as an associate professor in 1988. He was promoted to professor and appointed
faculty associate in the Survey Research Center in 1991, was appointed the Richard
Carl Jelinek Professor of Health Management and Policy in 1994, and appointed
professor of organizational behavior and human resources in 1999.
       Professor Alexander's research focused on issues dealing with organizational
arrangements in the health care sector, with particular emphasis on their environmental
determinants and contributions to comparative performance. A leading empirical
researcher in the area of health care governance, he studied how organizational
environments shape organizational structure, process, and effectiveness. His papers,
"Patterns of Decision Making in Multihospital Systems" and "Models of Governance in
Multihospital Systems: Implications for Hospital and System-Level Decision Making,"
were the first to define, and account for, variation in decision making in authority
relations between headquarters and hospitals in multihospital systems. Professor
Alexander has authored over 255 peer-reviewed journal articles, was editor of Medical
Care Research and Review for seven years, and served on the editorial boards of
numerous other journals. He served the School of Public Health as acting senior
associate dean for academic affairs (1997-98), acting dean (2001), and senior associate
dean for academic affairs (2000-03). He received the school's Excellence in Research
Award in 2007.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Jeffrey A.
Alexander professor emeritus of health management and policy and professor emeritus
of organizational behavior and human resource management.

York, in 1971. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor
in 1974, and was promoted to associate professor in 1977, and professor in 1982.
       Professor Thun participated in experiments at Brookhaven National Lab,
CERN, Fermilab, and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, which included searches
for new particles, studies of high-energy proton-proton, proton-antiproton and electronpositron collisions, and pioneering measurements of Z-boson and top quark properties.
More recently, he was involved in the international ATLAS experiment at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider, which led directly to the recent discovery of a particle
consistent with the Higgs boson. His work on ATLAS spanned the design, prototyping,
installation, commissioning, and performance assessment for the endcap muon
chambers. A consummate physicist, Professor Thun was dedicated to the singular goal
of advancing the boundaries of knowledge of the natural world. His intellect, vision,
and rigorous approach to the scientific method were matched by his genuine modesty.
He believed that scientists were like explorers and should follow the data and push
analyses into the unknown, uninhibited by excessive allegiance to speculative
hypotheses. A multi-dimensional individual, Thun penned novels and was a painter
whose works reflected a high degree of realism, precision, beauty, and creativity. His
numerous scientific interests included the nature of binocular vision and the physical
basis of consciousness.
       As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we extend our heartfelt
condolences to his wife, Melissa, and their three children.

OCTOBER MEETING, 2012


                                                             The University of Michigan

                                                                       October 19, 2012

        The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Harding Mott University Center on the
campus of the University of Michigan-Flint. Present were President Coleman and
Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White. Also
present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Provost
Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Interim Vice President Kowich, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President
Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
        President Coleman said that this meeting would be the final meeting on the Flint
Campus for Regents Maynard and Taylor, who are stepping down in December after 16
years of service. She thanked them for their many contributions, especially with
respect to the growth of students, programs, and facilities on the Flint Campus.
       President Coleman called attention to prestigious awards and recognition that
had been bestowed upon a number of University of Michigan faculty in recent weeks.
        She also noted that during the past fiscal year, faculty from all three campuses
reported a record 368 new inventions, and the launch of 11 new startup companies.
        Noting that election day was less than three weeks away, President Coleman
encouraged all members of the community to educate themselves about the candidates
and the issues, and then vote.
        President Coleman then invited Regent Deitch to introduce the first item of
business.
Statement from the Board of Regents
        Regent Deitch read the following statement:
               In February, the Board of Regents issued a unanimous resolution to conduct our own
        independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding both the delay in reporting and
        investigation of possession of child pornography by a University of Michigan medical resident.
               We made our intention clear: to insure that the unacceptable situation presented by this
        case is never repeated at the University of Michigan. I am speaking today as board chair, but I
        speak for all of my colleagues unanimously.
               We hired an external international law firm, Latham & Watkins LLP, to conduct a
        vigorous and fully independent investigation of the facts. And, the University retained outside
        experts, Margolis Healy & Associates, to examine the cultural and organizational issues that
        may have contributed to the delay.
               We also solicited the perspectives of our current University leadership, which has
        worked tirelessly in support of our efforts to review and address these issues.
               This work has now concluded. We have developed a detailed memo that summarizes
        our findings regarding the matter, and sets forth the remedial measures we will implement.


81



~


October Meeting, 2012


Today, we will share this memo publicly, as we promised we would, and I will offer some
highlights now.
         Based upon the extensive investigation and consultation, the Regents have reached the
following conclusions:
         First, there was a clear failure among University personnel to timely and effectively
communicate regarding the reported possession of child pornography by a medical resident.
Regardless of the individual reasons for not reporting promptly, this failure is categorically
unacceptable. It is incumbent upon all personnel who become aware of a concern of this gravity
to promptly notify law enforcement. There can be no exceptions to that rule.
         Second, certain University personnel (especially in the Health System and in the Office
of General Counsel) inappropriately investigated the reported child pornography information
independently, without involving an appropriate law enforcement agency, and determined there
was not sufficient evidence to further pursue the concerns. That assessment was wrong and
unacceptable. The individuals who made that determination are no longer employees of the
University.
         Third, the relationships and communication between the University's Health System
Security and the Department of Public Safety are broken and demand repair. There must be a
University wide system that guarantees timely and effective communication of potential serious
misconduct, as well as the safety and security of all of our University constituencies.
         To remedy the problems uncovered through our review, we have resolved that the
following will be done:
         1. Creation of the "Division of Public Safety and Security" to bring together all safety
         and security components of the University's Ann Arbor campus under a unified
         division.
         The division will be led by a newly appointed executive director of public safety and
         security, to whom the University chief of police and other security leadership will
         report directly. The executive director of DPSS will report directly to the president of
         the University.
         We expect this consolidation will improve efficacy and consistency in incident response
         protocols and procedures.
         Until a permanent director is hired, working with President Coleman, we will appoint
         University Police Chief Joe Piersante to serve as the interim executive director of
         DPSS. Chief Piersante is an experienced, respected, and dedicated law enforcement
         official and understands the concerns raised by our investigation, and we appreciate
         his willingness to serve in this important interim role.
         2. Formation of a search committee to conduct a nationwide search for an executive
         director for Public Safety & Security. The committee will be comprised of leaders
         inside and outside of the institution, including people with deep law enforcement
         expertise, and will search for the best candidate with proven organizational leadership
         and law enforcement experience.
         3. Development and implementation of a Unified Standard Practice Guide related to
         safety and security. We have asked President Coleman to oversee the development and
         implementation of a guide that will assure a shared vision of safety and security across
         the university, as well as create direct and accountable responsibility for handling
         issues.
         4. Continued implementation of improvements through the Safety & Security Steering
         Committee.
         Lastly, we note the efforts and progress made in recent months by the University 's
         Safety & Security Steering Committee. As detailed in the committee's update that we


82



~


October Meeting, 2012


                 are sharing today, the institution has instituted improvements in, among other things:
                 911 procedures, protocols for hospital incidents, shared communications across
                 University divisions, debriefing on major security incidents, and training regarding
                 duty to report requirements. We ask that the committee continue its efforts and report
                 back to us no later than January 2013 regarding further progress. We consider this to
                 be a matter of great urgency for the institution and will hold the committee responsible
                 for delivering meaningful and demonstrable change in a timely way.
                 In conclusion, as we noted in March, the situation that gave rise to these changes is
        terrible and unacceptable. We can never again have a delay in timely reporting to law
        enforcement of this kind of serious misconduct. While the situation was caused by the
        inexplicable decisions of individuals, we acknowledge institutional responsibility for fixing the
        problem.
                 We want to express our gratitude, and this is very important, to the University
        physician who brought forward these concerns last November. We commend that person for
        following through and making sure this information came to light in a manner that ultimately
        resulted in the arrest and successful prosecution of the former medical resident. The University
        community needs and relies upon people who are willing to step up and do the right thing. It is
        the University's policy and our firm expectation that all personnel will do just that. In addition
        to campus-wide 911 services for reporting crimes, the University maintains a Compliance
        Hotline through which anyone can raise concerns or allegations about any type of potential
        misconduct or safety issue. There will be no - no - retaliation against anyone in the University
        community for timely notification of misconduct or similar concerns.
                 We thank the investigative and prosecuting authorities at the University, in Washtenaw
        County and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit. They have been diligent and thorough in their
        response and prosecution of the former medical resident. We are grateful for their service.
                 The remedial changes we are ordering today are significant and will require
        considerable further resources and diligence. That is by design. The safety and security of our
        University family is sacrosanct. We must be and will always be fiercely vigilant when it comes to
        campus safety and security. We commit to the full and speedy implementation of these remedial
        mandates and will actively assess progress moving forward.
                 We know this has been very hard work, and many units on campus will be affected by
        the changes we are putting in place today. But we believe this has been an extremely important
        review process, with outcomes that will benefit the University community in the years ahead. All
        of us, unanimously, feel strongly that there is no greater priority than our community's safety,
        security, and well-being.
                 In conclusion, I want to thank Regent Ilitch, my predecessor as chair, and President
        Coleman for their leadership during these months. At the board's direction they worked
        together to put much of this work in motion and they have pursued it with diligence. I also want
        to add a thank you to Regent Taylor who gave voice to our concerns. They have had our full
        and unified support. Thank you.

        President Coleman thanked Regent Deitch for his thoughtful remarks, and the
regents for their diligence in this arduous, time-consuming, but critical effort. She also
thanked the consultants and the many university leaders who came together these past
months to have tough, honest conversations about organizational behavior, working
relationships, and processes.

        President Coleman said that the new management structure for campus safety
and security will go a long way toward ensuring the safety of the community. Because
safety is a shared responsibility, everyone must remain vigilant, and report concerns
quickly.

October Meeting, 2012


       President Coleman then introduced a supplemental agenda item to carry out the
actions set forth by Regent Deitch.
       On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent Darlow, the regents
unanimously approved the creation of the Division of Public Safety and Security, and
the appointment of Joe Piersante as interim executive director of the new Division. Mr.
Piersante's appointment is effective immediately and will end upon the appointment of
a permanent executive director.
Presentation: "Expanding our Footprint: K-12 initiatives in Southeast Michigan"
       President Coleman introduced Professor Robert Hahn, a member of the
provost's office on the Flint Campus.
       Professor Hahn described the Genesee Early College (GEC), an outreach
program for high school students through which, upon completion of grade 13, they
receive not only a high school diploma, but also 50+ UM-Flint college credits. He
introduced Christina Ramo, GEC graduate, who went on to earn a Bachelor of Science
degree at UM-Flint, and who then was accepted into the University of Michigan
Medical School.
       President Coleman then turned to the regular agenda.
Committee Reports
       Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, was joined by Regent Richner. Regent
White said the committee had reviewed the fiscal year 2012 Annual Report on
Investment Performance. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 distributions from
the endowment increased for the ninth straight year despite a slight decline in the total
value of the endowment to $7.7 billion. Distributions totaled $270 million, up from
$266 million the previous year. The endowment's annualized ten-year return, the focus
for long-term investments, is 9.6%, which is ahead of benchmarks and the S&P stock
index. Regent White thanked and recognized Eric Lundberg, chief investment officer,
Cheryl Soper, controller and director of financial operations, and Greg Tewksbury,
university treasurer.
       The other agenda items included a review of the debt program with Associate
Vice President Miranda and Treasurer Tewksbury, and the regular bi-monthly audit
update with Jeff Moelich, executive director of university audits.
       Health Affairs Committee. Regent Darlow, chair of the Health Affairs
Committee, reported that she and Regent Deitch met with President Coleman and
Provost Hanlon, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Dean Woolliscroft, UMHHC
CEO Doug Strong and CFO Paul Castillo. Executive Director of University Audits Jeff
Moelich provided an overview of the audit process relating to health care and a
summary of related audits. The committee received updates on the University's
experience with the fungal meningitis outbreak, including its impact at UMHS and St.
Joseph Mercy Hospital, and heard updates on the progress of the announced intention
to affiliate with Mid-Michigan Health, and on the financial challenges facing the health
system. The committee concluded with an in-depth and very positive update from
Dean Kate Potempa on the School of Nursing.

October Meeting, 2012


        Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Ilitch said
that participants in the meeting included Regents Newman and Taylor, Vice President
and Secretary Churchill, and for a portion of the meeting, President Coleman.
        Provost Hanlon provided a monthly update and gave an annual report on dean
and major director reviews and searches. Chancellor Little provided an update on the
Dearborn campus, and Chancellor Person provided an update on faculty and staff on
the Flint Campus. Vice President and Secretary Churchill reviewed a proposed revision
to the bylaw amendment procedure.
January 2013 Regent' Meeting
        Regent Ilitch the made the following announcement:
                I am pleased to report that in place of the previously scheduled board meeting on
        January 17th, the board of regents will be meeting for two days, on January 17 and 18, 2013,
        for an extended informal session. This informal session will take place in Los Angeles,
        California, so that the board can meet with major donors, alumni and thought leaders in higher
        education who are based in California.
               To put this in some context: As state support for this amazing institution has waned,
        the University has become increasingly dependent upon the generosity and support of donors to
        maintain our excellence. One of the largest bases of donor support for the University of
        Michigan is Southern California. In fact, California has the second largest out-of-state donor
        base, and there are more alumni in California, 41,000, than in any state except Michigan.
               The board and this institution need to cultivate these vitally important relationships.
               Regents will meet with three university presidents in California who are nationally
        recognized experts in higher education. As the board looks at the major issues facing the future
        of higher education - issues such as affordability and access, the changing nature of how
        students will learn (as we heard about last month in the presentation on Coursera), changes in
        health care delivery at academic medical centers, and ever increasing competition for research
        dollars to name just a few - there is great benefit in talking with others who are wrestling with
        similar issues.
        She said that the regents would use this time to welcome and orient two new
regents who will be joining the board upon the retirements of two long-standing
regents, Olivia Maynard and S. Martin Taylor.
        Regent Ilitch noted that the board would resume its regular schedule in Ann
Arbor on Feb. 21, 2013.
        President Coleman then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda

Shakespeare and styles courses. Under a grant from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, Professor Gwillim-Kerr toured the country, bringing Shakespeare in
Performance into university classrooms.
       The Regents now salute this gifted performer and teacher for her dedicated
service by naming Sarah-Jane Gwillim-Kerr clinical assistant professor emerita of
theatre and drama.

       On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Darlow, the regents

Michigan Stadium 2013 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic
        Executive Vice President Slottow submitted a request for approval of a special
liquor license to allow the sale of alcohol at the 2013 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic.
Regent Richner asked whether the license would need to be renegotiated if the game is
postponed. Vice President Wilbanks said that the license allows for a "contingency
date" of January 2, 2013, but any other change to the date, including possibly
rescheduling until 2014, would require a new license.
       On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Richner, the regents
unanimously approved the application for a Class C License and Catering Permit by
Sodexo Management Inc., for the 2013 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic hockey game
to be held at Michigan Stadium on January 1, 2013 (with a contingency date of January
2, 2013.)
Conflict of Interest Items
       President Coleman then turned to the seven conflict of interest items, each of
which requires six votes for approval, and which would be approved via a single
motion.
       On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Ilitch, the regents
unanimously approved the following seven items:
Authorization for the University of Michigan to Enter into Lease Agreements with Venture
Accelerator Firms located at the North Campus Research Complex
       The regents approved lease agreements for space in the North Campus Research
Complex start-up accelerator, located at 1600 Huron Parkway, Ann Arbor, with both
companies listed in the spreadsheet that is part of the Regents Communication. The
space will be utilized as office and lab space for research and business operations for
each respective company. The companies have separately entered into a relationship
agreement defining the relationship between the University of Michigan and them at
the accelerator. Because those named for each respective company included in the
Regents Communication (and listed below) are University of Michigan employees, and
are party to the lease by virtue of their share of the ownership of each respective
company, membership on respective tenant board of directors, or acting as an officer in
the tenant company, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
       1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and the

        Richard E. Burney, M.D., professor of surgery in the Medical School, will
retire from active faculty status on November 30, 2012.
       Dr. Burney received his A.B. and M.D. degrees from Harvard University in
1965 and 1969, respectively. He completed his internship (1969-70) and residency
(1970-74) in general surgery at the Yale-New Haven Medical Center. From 1974-76,
he served his military commitment at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was chief of
clinics at the U.S. Munson Army Hospital. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an assistant professor of surgery in 1976, and was promoted to associate
professor in 1983, and professor in 1992.
       Dr. Burney has held numerous leadership positions at the University of
Michigan Hospitals, including interim head of the section of emergency services (1985 -87, 1990-92), chief of emergency services (1985-92), medical director of survival flight
(1985-94), and chief of the Division of Colorectal Surgery (2005-07). He served on
over 40 University and Health System committees, including the University of
Michigan Transportation Research Institute Executive Committee and the Executive
Committee on Clinical Affairs. In the late 1970s, he was instrumental in the
development of a stable, advanced emergency medical services system for Washtenaw
and Livingston counties, and served as the first medical director of this system. He
served as president of the Washtenaw County Medical Society in 2003, and from 1994 -2004, he was a member of the Committee on Trauma of the American College of
Surgeons.
       Dr. Burney has authored over 130 peer-reviewed publications and 25 book
chapters. He served for many years on the editorial boards of The Journal of Trauma
and the Annals of Emergency Medicine. Dr. Burney was active in medical care quality
review organizations throughout his career, starting with the Area VII Professional
Standards Review Organization (1977-84) and continuing with the Michigan Peer
Review Organization (1984-2008), which he helped to establish and where he served as
president of the board from 1984-2006. He was appointed to the Michigan Board of
Medicine in 2008 and was elected chair of the board in 2012.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished physician and health educator for his
dedicated service by naming Richard B. Burney professor emeritus of surgery.

November Meeting, 2012


       William K. Wallach, M.A., associate director and archivist in the Bentley
Historical Library, will retire from active faculty status on November 30, 2012.
       Mr. Wallach received his B.A. degree from George Washington University in
1971 and his M.A. degree from the University of Minnesota in 1975. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as assistant director of the Bentley Historical Library in
1981. He was appointed associate archivist in 1983, and was promoted to archivist in
1988 and associate director in 2001.
       His early work focused on the conceptualization and administration of a
research fellowship program for archival professionals at the Bentley Library, funded
with a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The program, which ran from
1983-97, enabled and encouraged the most creative minds in the archival and related
professions to formulate and publish their ideas. It fostered systematic research on
problems relating to archival management and the scholarly use of modern
documentation. The program provided funding for 122 fellows who worked on 84
individual and team-based projects, and published more than 70 articles and
monographs. The resulting research significantly enriched the extant body of archival
literature relating to issues of the selection, use, understanding, and administration of
contemporary records. More recently, Mr. Wallach has overseen the Bentley Library's
visiting researcher program, which provides grants to scholars with promising projects
to conduct research at the Bentley Library. During the past 22 years, 175 scholars have
benefited from this program, and many have gone on to publish their work. Several of
these works have won major awards, including the Bancroft Prize, the National Book
Award, and the Pulitzer Prize.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming William
K. Wallach archivist emeritus.

       Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial for Christopher M.
Peterson, Arthur F. Thurnau Professor and professor psychology, who died on October
9, 2012 at the age of 62.
        The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Christopher M. Peterson, Ph.D., Arthur F. Thurnau Professor and
professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. Professor
Peterson died on October 9, 2012, at age 62.
       Professor Peterson received his B.S. degree from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign in 1972, and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of
Colorado in 1974 and 1976, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty
as an associate professor in 1986, and was promoted to professor in 1990. He was
named Arthur F. Thurnau Professor in 1999.
       Professor Peterson was a pioneer in two main research areas of clinical and
personality psychology. His work in the first area, explanatory styles, determined that
the way people explain events can predict a variety of outcomes such as health and
achievement. More recently, Professor Peterson had been a leader in the field of
positive psychology, the scientific study of character strengths and human thriving. His
work has been utilized in clinical settings, schools, communities, and organizations to
boost mental health. Professor Peterson published more than 350 scholarly works,
including four undergraduate psychology textbooks, and is one of the most highly cited

published researchers in the last 30 years. His work has been featured broadly in the
public media, including Good Morning America, National Public Radio, and The New
York Times.
       Professor Peterson was a legendary educator who taught thousands of students
in some of the University's largest courses.  His mentoring of graduate and
undergraduate students was unparalleled, as reflected by his service on 130 Ph.D.
dissertation committees and 70 undergraduate honors theses committees. His
excellence in teaching earned him the Thurnau Professorship and the University's 2010
Golden Apple Award.
       Professor Peterson will be remembered for his wisdom, wit, and warmth. As
we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we extend our heartfelt condolences to his
family.

Conflict of Interest Items
        President Coleman then turned to the 10 conflict of interest items, each of which

        On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent White, the regents

        The regents unanimously approved an agreement with ImBio, LLC (the
"Company") to jointly develop a fully automated software application for the purpose

Procedure for Revising Regents' Bylaws

        Vice President Churchill informed the regents these procedures, which were
first adopted in 1975, have been updated to make them consistent with current practice
including, in particular, recognizing the role of the Board of Regents' Personnel,
Compensation and Governance Committee.
        Procedure for Revising Regents' Bylaws
        (revised October 2012)

        Authority to amend the Bylaws of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan rests with
        the Board of Regents. Bylaw Section 14.03 describes the amendment process:

                 "The bylaws may be amended at any regular meeting of the board, or at any special
                 meeting, provided notice is given to each regent one week in advance. Such notice
                 shall be accompanied by a copy of the proposed amendment or amendments."

        Final responsibility for proposing amendments to the bylaws rests with the regents, the
        president, and the university's executive officers.

        The following procedures will be followed before revisions to the bylaws are recommended to
        the regents for approval:

        1.       Proposals originating from departments or administrative units will be reviewed and
                 approved by the appropriate school, college or unit. This review will include
                 consultation with appropriate faculty and student groups. The school, college, or unit
                 then submits the proposal to the appropriate executive officer, along with supporting
                 rationale.
        2.       Proposals originating from special committees, advisory groups, committees of the
                 senate, or other university bodies will be submitted to the appropriate executive officer,
                 along with supporting rationale.
        3.       Proposals originating with an executive officer will be vetted by university units and
                 groups that may be affected by the proposal.
        4.       After the proposed revision has been vetted, the executive officer will submit the
                 proposal to the vice president and secretary of the university (VPS), who will submit it
                 to the Office of the Vice President and General Counsel (OGC) for review.
        5.       Following review by the OGC, the VPS will submit the proposal to the executive
                 officers group for review and approval.
        6.       The VPS will then submit the proposal to the PCG Committee for review. Following
                 that review, the VPS will submit the proposed bylaw amendment to the University

November Meeting, 2012


               Record for a two-week public comment period. Comments received are considered
               prior to submission to the board for approval.
        7.     Upon approval by the board, a revised bylaw is printed verbatim in the Proceedings of
               the Board of Regents and on the regents' website.

       The Regents' PCG Committee or the Board of Regents may ask the VPS to draft a proposed
       bylaw amendment, which will be handled in accordance with these procedures unless the
       president or regents waive these procedures. These procedures may also be waived when a prior
       regents' action (e.g., a change in name of a school or college) necessitates a corresponding
       housekeeping change to the bylaws.

Reorganization of the Division of Government Relations, University of MichiganDearborn
        Chancellor Little informed the regents that the division of Government
Relations has been reorganized and the position of vice chancellor for government
relations will be renamed to the vice chancellor for external relations.

                          OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO

        WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") is a constitutional body

        WHEREAS, the Issuer has determined that combining the General Revenues and Hospital
Gross Revenues into a single revenue pledge as the payment source of, and as security for, all of the
Issuer's General Revenue Bonds and other obligations secured by a lien on General Revenues, will result
in lower borrowing costs for the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers, will permit the

General Revenue Bonds (collectively, the "Senior Lien Indebtedness"); and
        WHEREAS, the Issuer has determined that it is necessary and desirable to refund all of the
outstanding Senior Lien Indebtedness in order to eliminate the senior lien on the components of General
Revenues that presently secure the Senior Lien Indebtedness, and thereby permit the pledge by the Issuer
of all components of General Revenues, on an equal and parity basis, as security for the payment of all
General Revenue Bonds and other obligations of the Issuer secured by a lien on General Revenues; and
        WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously entered into (i) certain interest rate swap agreements
related to certain of the Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds and payable from Hospital Gross Revenues,
(ii) an interest rate swap agreement related to certain of the outstanding Senior Lien Indebtedness and

Officer. Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may bear interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a
portion of their term, at indexed or market established rates or any combination thereof, and the variable
rate of interest shall not exceed the lesser of the maximum rate permitted by law or the maximum rate, if
any, to be specified in the Trust Indenture. The Bonds may be subject to redemption or call for purchase
prior to maturity at the times and prices and in the manner as shall be established by an Authorized
Officer, but no redemption premium shall exceed 3% of the principal amount being redeemed unless the
redemption price is based on a "make whole" formula, in which case no redemption premium shall
exceed 40% of the principal amount being redeemed. Interest on the Bonds shall be payable at such
times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer. The Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form
in denominations, shall be payable as to principal and interest in the manner, shall be subject to transfer
and exchange, and shall be executed and authenticated, all as shall be provided in the Trust Indenture.
The Bonds shall be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement or through a
competitive sale or bidding process pursuant to a Notice of Sale for a price to be established by an
Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's discount, exclusive of original issue discount, shall not exceed
1.50% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued interest, if any, from the dated date of the Bonds to
the date of delivery thereof.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of the holder thereof or
to mandatory tender for purchase. The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender
for purchase may be limited to remarketing proceeds of such Bonds, or may be made payable from
General Revenues (as defined in Section 3 below), from available cash reserves of the University, subject
to such limitations as may be specified in the Trust Indenture, or from, directly or as support for the cash
reserves, a letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity device, or
one or more of the same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the "Liquidity Device"), all as shall be
determined by an Authorized Officer. The Liquidity Device, or any part thereof, may also be used to
provide liquidity for any other indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer, including the Notes and the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds. Any reimbursement obligation for draws under the Liquidity
Device shall be a limited and not a general obligation of the Issuer, payable from, and may be secured by
a pledge of, General Revenues (as defined in Section 3 below). Any Authorized Officer is authorized to
execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any agreements or instruments necessary to obtain,
maintain, renew or replace, and provide for repayments under, any Liquidity Device deemed by such
officer to be required for the purposes of this Resolution.

November Meeting, 2012-Appendix


Any Bonds authorized and issued hereunder may, at any time, upon direction of an Authorized Officer,
be subsequently converted to another mode or structure authorized hereby, either through procedures
established in the Trust Indenture pertaining thereto, or through the issuance hereunder of refunding
bonds to refund and replace the outstanding Bonds to be converted. Any such refunding bonds issued
hereunder shall be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Resolution. Any
Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any documents or
instruments, including but not limited to, any amendments to the Trust Indenture, necessary or convenient
for the purpose of accomplishing the conversion as described in this paragraph.
In connection with the refunding of the Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds and outstanding Senior
Lien Indebtedness, any Authorized Officer may, on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, modify any
Existing Swap Agreement related to the Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds or Senior Lien
Indebtedness, in whole or in part, and relate any such Existing Swap Agreement to any portion of the debt
service on the Bonds, the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds or the Notes, or terminate any such
Existing Swap Agreement, in whole or in part, and any fees or termination payments required in
connection with any such modifications or terminations may be paid from the proceeds of the Bonds, or
from available funds of the Issuer. If, upon the refunding of the Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds
and outstanding Senior Lien Indebtedness, any Existing Swap Agreement related to the Outstanding
Hospital Revenue Bonds or Senior Lien Indebtedness is to be related to any portion of the Bonds, the
Outstanding General Revenue Bonds or the Notes, such Existing Swap Agreement may be secured by the
combined pledge of General Revenue Bonds as provided in Section 3 hereof.
In relation to the debt service on all or any portion of the Bonds, or in relation to debt service on all or
any portion of the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, any of the Authorized Officers may, at any time,
on behalf of and as the act of the Issuer, enter into or terminate or modify an interest rate swap, cap,
forward starting swap, option, swaption, rate lock or similar agreement or agreements (collectively, the
"Swap Agreement") with a counter-party or counter-parties selected or to be selected by the Authorized
Officer. Such Swap Agreement shall provide for payments between the Issuer and the counterparty
related to interest on all or a portion of the Bonds or the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds, at indexed
or market established rates. If the Swap Agreement is entered into at approximately the same time as the
issuance of the Bonds and is related to the Bonds, the expected effective interest rates on the Bonds to
which the Swap Agreement relates, taking into account the effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be within
the limitations set forth herein. Any Swap Agreement in the form of an option, swaption or forward
starting swap may, if the Bonds to which such agreement relates are not ultimately issued, be required to
be terminated, with a possibility of a resulting termination payment due by the University.
3. The combination of the General Revenues and the Hospital Gross Revenues of the Issuer into a single
revenue pledge, as described in this Section 3, is hereby authorized and approved. Upon issuance of the
Bonds, the "General Revenues" shall consist of (i) all General Revenues of the Issuer as defined in the
Trust Agreements pursuant to which the Outstanding General Revenue Bonds were issued, plus, (ii) from
and after the date on which all Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds have been paid or are no longer
deemed to be outstanding in accordance with the terms thereof, all Hospital Gross Revenues (as shall be
defined in the Trust Indenture in a manner generally consistent with the definition thereof contained in
the Master Indenture, as supplemented, under which the Outstanding Hospital Revenue Bonds were
issued); provided, however, that the Trust Indenture may provide for the exclusion from Hospital Gross
Revenues of any revenues derived from certain hospital facilities, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Trust Agreement as shall be approved by an Authorized Officer. If determined to be
appropriate by an Authorized Officer, the Trust Indenture may include provisions that permit the
subsequent exclusion of Hospital Gross Revenues from the definition of General Revenues upon
conditions to be determined by an Authorized Officer. From and after the date on which all outstanding
Senior Lien Indebtedness has been paid or is no longer deemed to be outstanding in accordance with the
terms thereof, the pledge of General Revenues shall cease to be subject to the prior and superior lien on
the portions of the General Revenues securing the Senior Lien Indebtedness.
The Bonds, and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement, if any, and the Liquidity Device,
if any, except as specifically provided below in this Section 3, shall be limited and not general obligations
of the Issuer payable from and secured by a lien on the combined General Revenues of the Issuer as
described in this Section 3.

                                                                       Ann Arbor
                                                               December 13, 2012

       The regents convened at 4:00 p.m. in the Anderson Room, Michigan Union.
Present were President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Ilitch, Maynard,
Newman, Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary
Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Interim Vice
President Kowich, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive
Vice President Pescovitz, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow,
and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
       President Coleman congratulated several individuals who are in transition and
have made significant contributions to the University. She announced that Provost Phil
Hanlon has been named president of Dartmouth College, and that Dartmouth will be in
the hands of an exceptional leader and teacher when Provost Hanlon assumes his new
responsibilities in the spring. President Coleman thanked Debra Kowich, who has
served as an outstanding interim vice president and general counsel for the past seven
months.
       She noted this is the last meeting for Regents Olivia Maynard and S. Martin
Taylor, concluding 32 years of combined service to the University. Regents Maynard
and Taylor were members of the board that invited President Coleman to lead the
University of Michigan, and she thanked them for their support and counsel.
        Regent Darlow read the following Regents' Resolution, and presented it to
Regent Maynard:
              The Regents of the University of Michigan extend heartfelt
       appreciation and warmest personal regards to Olivia P. Maynard, as she
       concludes sixteen years of exemplary service on the Board of Regents.
              A loyal alumna of the School of Social Work and former director
       of the Michigan Office of Services to the Aging, Regent Maynard is
       currently president of the Michigan Prospect, a non-profit public policy
       institute. She is a trustee of the C.S. Mott Foundation, and is a board
       member of the Nature Conservancy of Michigan, the McLaren Regional
       Medical Center, and several foundations.
              Throughout her tenure, Regent Maynard has demonstrated her
       strong support for the University's affirmative action efforts, women's
       and gender equity issues, and initiatives to increase the diversity of
       students and faculty. Together with her husband, Olof Karlstrom,
       Regent Maynard established a generous endowment in the School of
       Social Work aimed at improving social justice and alleviating poverty
       and social inequality, and they have provided additional support to the


149



~


December Meeting, 2012


       School of Education, the Law School, and the College of LS&A. As a
       resident of the greater Flint community and a regular presence on the
       Flint campus, Regent Maynard believes strongly in the value that the
       regional campuses add to the University as a whole and to the
       communities where they reside.
              The regents commend Regent Maynard for her consistent
       advocacy of and commitment to the values she holds dear, her generous
       financial support for the University, and her warm and welcoming
       presence on the board. It is with great respect and gratitude that we
       name Olivia P. Maynard Regent Emerita of the University of Michigan.
       Regent Deitch read the following Regents' Resolution, and presented it to
Regent Taylor:
              The Regents of the University of Michigan extend heartfelt
       gratitude and appreciation to S. Martin Taylor, as he concludes sixteen
       years of distinguished service as a member of the Board of Regents.
              Regent Taylor's wide-ranging career includes service as director
       of the Michigan Employment Security Commission, director of the
       Michigan Department of Labor, executive vice president of DTE Energy
       Company, and interim president of Detroit Renaissance. He has also
       held leadership positions in numerous civic and non-profit organizations
       in the greater Detroit area.  This rich combination of executive
       experience in the business, civic, and public sectors has been an
       invaluable asset to the board and the University during his tenure.
              As chair of the Regents' Personnel, Compensation      and
       Governance Committee, Regent Taylor established best practices and
       procedures that will guide the committee's work well into the future. His
       stalwart commitment to the issues he values, including diversity in all of
       its forms, the safety of every member of the University community, the
       importance of intercollegiate athletics, and maintaining the excellence of
       our academic enterprise, will be a lasting part of his legacy. Regent
       Taylor's inimitable style - pithy, succinct, and to the point - will be
       missed.
              The Regents commend Regent Taylor for his generous service,
       loyalty, and commitment to the University. It is with ongoing gratitude
       and the highest regard for his many contributions that we name S.
       Martin Taylor Regent Emeritus of the University of Michigan.
       Regent Deitch acknowledged Nancy Asin, assistant secretary of the university,
who is retiring after 36 years of service on December 31, 2012.
       President Coleman extended congratulations to the students who will be
concluding their Michigan career at commencement on Sunday, and noted that the
speaker will be Dr. Raynard Kington, president of Grinnell College.

memoirs.

       Barbara S. Adams, M.D., clinical professor of pediatrics and communicable
diseases in the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on October 31, 2012.
       Dr. Adams received her B.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1969,
and her M.D. degree from Tufts University in 1974. Following an internship at the

Michigan from 1981-85, she joined the faculty as a lecturer in the Department of
Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases in 1985.  She was promoted to assistant
professor in 1992, clinical associate professor in 1997, and clinical professor in 2005.
From 1988-92, she was also a research investigator in the Department of Internal
Medicine.
       A dedicated and highly valued clinician, investigator, and teacher, Dr. Adams'
research and clinical work focused on juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile
idiopathic arthritis. She has been recognized as an excellent teacher and mentor for
medical students, house officers, and fellows, and has been project director of the
Pediatric Rheumatology Fellowship since 1999. She served as medical director of the
Pediatric Multispecialty Clinics from 1996-2005, and she was named division director
of pediatric rheumatology in 1997. Dr. Adams authored 18 peer-reviewed articles, three
book chapters, and numerous scientific abstracts, and presented more than 50 invited
lectures at national or international venues. Since 2002, she has been a member of the
medical advisory board of Arthritis Today. Dr. Adams received an American College of
Rheumatology Clinician Scholar Educator Award from 2002-05. In 2003, she received
the DTE Energy Foundation Community Luminary Award on behalf of the State of

1994-98 he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Colorado. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1998, and was
promoted to associate professor in 2004, and professor in 2010. From 1998-2009, he
held an additional appointment as assistant research professor in the Institute of
Gerontology.
       Professor Hunt made numerous outstanding scientific contributions that had a
significant impact in the  areas of microtubule  self-assembly  and  mitosis,
nanofabrication via ultrafast laser machining, and asymmetric stem cell division. He
published the first computational model of mitosis that elucidated the molecular
mechanical basis of mitosis. His research group has pioneered the use of optical
tweezers to measure single microtubule self-assembly at the nanometer-scale, creating a
molecular mechanistic framework with which to understand how microtubule-directed
anticancer drugs exert their therapeutic influence. His group also studied the
applications of applied femtosecond laser pulsing to create nanoscale features with high
precision and accuracy. In collaboration with stem cell biologists, Professor Hunt
discovered that centrosome mis-orientation reduces the ability of stem cells to divide,
and his expertise in the dynamics of microtubules was vital in establishing this
important link between the cytoskeleton and stem cell division. Professor Hunt was a
truly talented and inspiring teacher who helped to design a modern biomedical
engineering curriculum with a strong focus on principles of cellular and molecular
engineering. Two of his courses-Molecular and Cellular Biomechanics and
Quantitative Cell Biology-will have a lasting impact on biomedical engineering
education at the University of Michigan and beyond. Professor Hunt was a caring and
supportive mentor to ten Ph.D. students who have gone on to distinguished careers in

Conflict of Interest Items
        President Coleman said the agenda includes four conflict of interest items, each
of which requires six votes for approval, and which would be approved via a single
motion.
        On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Darlow, the regents
unanimously approved the following four items:
Authorization for the University of Michigan to Enter into a Sub-Lease Agreement with JV
Biolabs, LLC
        The regents unanimously approved a Sub-Lease agreement with JV Biolabs,
LLC (the "Company") for 439 square feet of property located at 2900 Huron Parkway,
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
        Because Professors Kent Johnson and James Varani, University of Michigan
employees, are also partial owners of the Company, this agreement falls under the State
of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
        1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan, and JV
           Biolabs, LLC.
        2. The agreement is for a sub-lease of 439 square feet in a building at 2900 Huron

           additional one-year term upon mutual agreement. Tenant will be responsible for its
           prorated portion of the operating expenses of the building which is included in the
           monthly rent.
        3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that University of Michigan employees
           Kent Johnson and James Varani are also partial owner of JV Biolabs, LLC.
Authorization for the University to Contract with Avicenna Medical Systems
        The regents unanimously approved a contract with Avicenna Medical Systems,
(the "Company") to purchase a license for Avitracks, a chronic disease management
software that provides increased patient safety and workflow efficiencies currently not
available in the hospital's electronic medical records.
        Because Frank Pelosi, Erdwing Coronado, and Khaled El-Safty, University of
Michigan employees, are also owners of the Company, this agreement falls under the
State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
        1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan, its Health
           System's Department of Dermatology, and Avicenna Medical Systems.

           provides increased patient safety and workflow efficiencies currently not available in
           the hospital's electronic medical records. The contract period is from June, 2012 to
           June, 2015. The Department of Dermatology will be purchasing access on a six
           month basis with option for renewal at the end of each six month period for a
           potential total cost of $18,000.
        3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that University of Michigan employees
           Frank Pelosi, Erdwing Coronado and Khaled El-Safty, are owners of Avicenna.

December Meeting, 2012


License Agreement between the University of Michigan and Echo360, Inc.

          The Regents unanimously approved an agreement with Echo360, Inc. (the
"Company") to obtain a license from the University of Michigan to the University's
rights associated with the following technology: UM File No. 3536, entitled: Webbased Interactive Classroom System: LectureTools.

        Because Professor Perry Samson, University of Michigan employee, is also
partial owner of the Company, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan
Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with
statutory requirements:
        1. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Echo360,
            Inc.
        2. Agreement terms include granting the Company an exclusive license to the software,
            including the rights to create derivatives. The University will retain ownership of the
            technology and may continue to further develop it and use it internally. No use of
            University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University employees is
            obligated or contemplated under the Agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees
            and indemnification apply, and the Agreement may be amended by consent of the
            parties, such as adding related technology. University procedures for approval of
            these changes will be followed and additional conflict of interest review will be done
            as appropriate.
        3. The pecuniary interests of Dr. Samson arise from his ownership interest in Echo360,
            Inc.

Master Agreement between the University of Michigan and Vortex Hydro Energy, LLC

          The Regents unanimously approved a Master Agreement with Vortex Hydro
Energy, LLC (the "Company") to have the University participate in various projects
that the Company will support and desires to use facilities of the University for projects
related to research and development of technologies to the Company by the University.

        Because Professor Michael Bernitsas, a University of Michigan employee, is an
owner of the Company, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
        4. Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Vortex
            Hydro Energy, LLC.
        5. The University will enter into a Master Agreement with the Company that will cover
            standard procedures for performance of projects as well as provisions implementing
            University and federal policies related to intellectual property and publication. The
            Master Agreement will cover an initial five-year period with a total authorization not
            to exceed Two Million Dollars. The University will use standard sponsored project
            accounting procedures to determine the cost of each project under this Master
            Agreement. Budgets will be reviewed and approved by authorized representatives of
            each department and school/college where projects are to be performed. The Master
            Agreement will allow the University and the Company to specify projects that the
            University will conduct under the terms of the Master Agreement. Since sponsored
            projects are often amended, the Master Agreement includes provisions for changes in
            time, amount, and scope of each supported project. University procedures for
            approval of each project will be followed and additional review by the OVPR
            Conflict of Interest Review Committee will be done on a project-by-project basis.
        6. The pecuniary interest of Dr. Bernitsas arises from his ownership interest in Vortex
            Hydro Energy, LLC.

                                                                       Ann Arbor
                                                                February 21, 2013

       The regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Anderson Room, Michigan Union.
Present were President Coleman and Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Deitch, Diggs, Ilitch,
Newman, Richner, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary
Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Provost Hanlon, Vice President Harper, Chancellor
Little, Vice President Lynch, Vice President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice
President Pescovitz, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, and
Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
       President Coleman welcomed Regents Bernstein and Diggs to their first
meeting, noting that the two of them collectively hold five UM degrees, including a
juris doctorate and a medical degree. She also noted that the agenda includes a request
for approval of Martha Pollack as the University's next provost and executive vice
president for academic affairs.
        President Coleman then commented on Professor Yukiko Yamashita of the
Life Sciences Institute and the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, who
was awarded a $500,000 grant from the W.M. Keck Foundation for her work in
studying how stem cells divide. She commended Professor of Mathematics, Steven
DeBacker, a Thurnau professor who was named the 2012 Professor of the Year by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for
Advancement and Support of Education. Provost Hanlon added that Professor
DeBacker's encouragement and support of students and mathematics has made him a
teacher who is considered by students to be both difficult and great.
        Regent Deitch officially presented Professor DeBacker with the award, and
thanked him for his outstanding contribution to the University.
       Regent Deitch, continued with an update on the Regents' meetings in California
in January to meet with donors, and university leaders. He said that the trip was a first,
and benefitted the university in several ways, including providing an opportunity to get
to know the two new regents, meeting distinguished university leaders from UC
Berkley, and Stanford, and connecting with an important donor constituency. Southern
California is an important area in terms of donors and private support, and donors
acknowledged their appreciation of the Regents' outreach.
       President Coleman noted that the University of Michigan continues to be the
number one public university for research spending; yet federal spending cuts loom
large in these precarious times. It is in this context that she invited Stephen Forrest,
vice president for research, to present his annual report.

Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
       President Coleman announced that the University had received a $50 million
gift for the graduate program in creative writing from alumna Helen Zell, the largest
gift ever to the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts. She expressed her deep
gratitude to Helen and the Zell Family Foundation for their support.
       Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter will be the speaker for the spring
commencement program. He is one of seven individuals recommend for honorary
degrees on the agenda.
       She noted the many student-athletes are currently competing in various sports
for NCAA championships including men's basketball, women's basketball, women's
swimming and diving, and wrestling.
       President Coleman continued, saying that this is an exciting day for the Health
System and for the entire University. She recognized the ongoing generosity of the late
Jean and Samuel Frankel, and welcomed their son, Stanley, as well as family friend
Arthur Weiss.
       Sam and Jean Frankel were Michigan students whose name is well known on
campus because of their philanthropy. In particular, the Jean and Samuel Frankel
Center for Judaic Studies and the Frankel Institute of Advanced Judaic Studies, are
leading programs of their kind in the United States.
       Today they are publicly recognized, for the first time, for their exceptional gift
to the Cardiovascular Center (CVC), and the Regents are asked to recognize their
generosity by naming the CVC the Samuel and Jean Frankel Cardiovascular Center.
       Ora Pescovitz, executive vice president for medical affairs, welcomed the
leadership team from the CVC. The Frankel's first gift, in 2007, given anonymously,
guaranteed a new way of approaching the diagnosis and treatment of patients with
cardiovascular disease. This second gift, also for $25 million, makes the CVC the
national leader in cardiovascular care. She thanked the Frankel family for their
investment in the future of healthcare, and for partnering to redefine excellence through
innovation. She also thanked the development team, led by Vice President for
Development Jerry May, for their contribution to this partnership.

continuing their great legacy of supporting Jewish education, philanthropy, and health
care.
       Regent Newman expressed thanks on behalf of all of the Regents, and said she
was pleased that Stanley was present so that he could be thanked personally. She
added, "through your generosity here you show the real Michigan Difference, and we
are so grateful."
       Regent Ilitch echoed Newman's comments, and said "Thank you. This is a
wonderful way to start a meeting. My cup runneth over. If there were a Stanley Cup of
philanthropy, I would present it to you."
       Regent Bernstein said he was pleased to make his first comments at a public
Regents' meeting about the Frankel family. He continued, "since I was 19 or 20 I used
to schlep to Troy to have breakfast, as president of the Hillel, and Stanley was the
president of the Board of Trustees. I knew about his philanthropic leadership and his
intelligence, and passion for the university. So it's a great honor to be here to observe
this and celebrate it."
       Stanley Frankel said that he learned from his parents to "say little and do much.
We are just the facilitators. The doers are the faculty and staff and the leadership of the
CVC and that's what is important. We look forward to continuing."
       On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved the naming of the University of Michigan Samuel and Jean
Frankel Cardiovascular Center.

       Vice Provost Pollack said that value and affordability are at the forefront of
discussions about a university education. Currently, the University of Michigan has 99
graduate programs in the top 10 nationally, is ranked #12 in world reputation, and has
the number one public research portfolio. The challenges are significant: the average
annual increase in tuition revenue during the past decade has been 5.09%, due to a
reduction in state appropriations, the University's investment in financial aid, and cost
increases. In one decade the state of Michigan has dropped from 14th to 39th in terms of
appropriation per student. The University has responded with an emphasis on financial
aid, covering 100% of demonstrated need for in-state students. At the same time,
efforts to control costs, increase philanthropic priorities and explore alternative revenue
sources continue.
       Regent Newman commented, "A lot of responsibility is placed on the state.
When I came on the board the budget was close to $2 billion, and today it's $6 billion.
Decisions to grow the university and to grow the budget, add programs and build
buildings are our decisions. We have made them irrespective of what the state
appropriation is. If we want to take into account each year not to do something because
of state appropriations, or declining appropriation, we need to manage that. I'm not

suggesting that the state couldn't do more, but we also make decisions and have some
responsibility for that too."

                                                                      Ann Arbor

Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
       President Coleman began by recognizing the grief that the people of Boston are
experiencing due to a senseless act of violence, and also the community of West Texas,
recovering from a terrible industrial accident. She offered condolences and well
wishes.
       President Coleman then recognized the accomplishments of some exceptional
student-athletes. The men's swimming and diving team won the NCAA national
championship - the 54th overall national title for a Michigan team, and the program's
19th national title, making it the University's most successful athletic program.
       Regent Bernstein, presented a resolution to Coach Bottom and the team:
              The Regents of the University of Michigan applaud and
       congratulate the men's swimming and diving team on their record       breaking season, culminating with the team's 12th NCAA Championship
       on March 30, 2013, the most of any swimming and diving program in
       history.
              Michigan finished the season with an 8-0 dual-meet record.
       Fourteen Michigan swimmers earned a total of 40 NCAA All-American
       honors, including 2012 U.S. Olympian Connor Jaeger, who won
       individual NCAA titles in the 500-yard freestyle and 1,650-yard
       freestyle. The 200-yard medley relay team of Miguel Ortiz, Bruno Ortiz,
       Sean Fletcher and Zack Turk also won gold, setting new NCAA, U.S.
       Open, NCAA Championship and program records with their winning
       swim. The Wolverines won the Big Ten Championship for the third       straight year (and 37th time in program history), with a sweep of all five
       relays for the first time ever.
              The season was appropriately capped off with Connor Jaeger
       named the 2013 Big Ten Swimmer of the Year, and head coach Mike
       Bottom the CSCAA Head Swimming Coach of the Year. Collectively, the
       team's talent overflows the confines of the pool, with 18 of its 45
       members earning Academic All-Big Ten honors.

April Meeting, 2013


              The Regents now salute the men's swimming and diving team,
       including Coach Bottom and his staff, for their national championship.

       President Coleman congratulated Coach John Beilein and the men's basketball
team, which competed in the national championship game. Regent Newman presented
the following resolution:
              The Regents of the University of Michigan salute and
       congratulate the men's basketball team on a remarkable season. From
       November through March Madness into the NCAA Final Four and
       Championship Game in Atlanta, you gave our entire University family
       wonderful memories that will last a lifetime. It was a Big Dance, indeed.
              You are a team with many stakeholders -from the Maize Rage to
       the pep band, from the cheer team to fans of all ages. But as the
       tournament events showed us, you earned support and admiration from a
       global community of alumni and friends.
              Every young man on this team exemplifies what it means to be a
       student athlete   at Michigan. Your academic    accomplishments,
       athleticism, poise, confidence, skill and determination represent the best
       of Michigan. The 2012 - 2013 men's basketball team, among the
       youngest in the tournament, showed a collective maturity with great
       courage and resolve.
              We also congratulate Coach John Beilein and the basketball
       program's dedicated assistant coaches and staff, and thank you all for
       representing this institution so well. In his career at Michigan, Coach
       Beilein has honored our traditions. A teacher and mentor to his players,
       with a focus on the well-being of all.
              The Regents applaud each member of the men's basketball team,
       Coach Beilein, the assistant coaches and the basketball program staff
       Your thrilling season inspired us. In your accomplishments, we see again
       what makes Michigan Michigan: Heart. Integrity. Spirit. Teamwork.
       Perseverance. Excellence.

       Several club sports also won national championships. The Michigan Fencing
Club and the Michigan Rifle Team won national titles, and for the first time in its
history, the Michigan Cheerleading Team won a national championship.
       President Coleman continued, saying that this is the final meeting with Phil
Hanlon, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs, who will become the
president of his alma mater, Dartmouth College on July 1, 2013. Provost Hanlon has
been a model of integrity, patience and creative thinking, and will be missed
tremendously.
       Regent White, presented the following resolution to Provost Hanlon:
              The Regents of the University of Michigan extend heartfelt
       congratulations to Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic

       Affairs, Philip J. Hanlon as he leaves the University on May 31, 2013, to
       become president of Dartmouth College.
              Provost Hanlon joined the Department of Mathematics in the
       College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1986, and was later
       named a Donald J. Lewis Collegiate Professor of Mathematics. He was
       promoted to Associate Dean for Planning and Finance in the College of
       Literature, Science, and the Arts, Associate Provost for Academic and
       Budgetary Affairs, and Vice Provost. He remains, at his very core, a
       talented and passionate teacher of mathematics, earning both an
       Education Excellence Award, and an Arthur F. Thurnau professorship.
              As an administrator and an academic, he valued the pillars of
       access, quality and research, never compromising on academic
       excellence, and continuing to enhance opportunities for service learning
       and entrepreneurship. With his strong command of budgetary issues,
       and a thoughtful leadership style, he has been an effective steward of the
       University resources in very challenging financial times. Appointed
       Provost on July 1, 2010, he has been a creative, progressive thinker, a
       keeper of strong values, and an unsung hero for diversity on campus.
       He is an avid Michigan sports fan, and is beloved by his colleagues for
       his calm but firm approach, warm demeanor, and wonderful humor.
              The Regents salute Provost Philip J. Hanlon and congratulate
       him on returning to his alma mater to become the eighteenth president of
       Dartmouth College.

       Regent White added that she will miss his friendship and leadership, and she
wished him the best of luck. Provost Hanlon thanked President Coleman and the
Regents for the privilege of serving as Provost of the University of Michigan.
       President Coleman continued, "Ours is a university unlike any other, and there
is no place I would rather be. I have told the Board of Regents that Michigan is where I
wish to conclude my career. I will retire as president when my contract ends on July
31st of 2014.
       "The University of Michigan deserves the best in a leader, and I want to give
the Board ample time to select the next president. I am committed to working with the
Board members to ensure a smooth leadership transition. Leading the University of
Michigan is the most challenging and rewarding work of my career. It is a tremendous
privilege and one that continually energizes me. I am extremely proud of the work we
have done, together, to make Michigan more vibrant, more accessible and more global.
I fully anticipate the next 15 months will be like my previous 11 years - busy." She
said that she and her husband, Ken, plan to stay in Ann Arbor and remain active in the
community.
       Regent Newman said, "Mary Sue Coleman has been an extraordinary leader for
an extraordinary university. She has dedicated herself to advancing the academic
excellence of UM. Working with the board, she has positioned the university for future

April Meeting, 2013


impact in critical faculty hires, growth of the research enterprise, new and renovated
facilities, and a strong philanthropic base that becomes increasingly important. I believe
that years from now historians will rightly credit her with successfully and skillfully
leading UM through its most challenging economic era since the depression. The
Board is profoundly grateful for her service and we anticipate working closely with her
on an orderly leadership transition.
       "The Board will now turn its attention to hiring the 14th president of the
University of Michigan. Hiring a president is the most critical job of the board and we
will seek an exceptional candidate to lead the university into its third century. There
are many details to finalize, and we anticipate a formal search will begin this summer."
       Regent Ilitch said it has been a wonderful run, and that she agreed with Regent
Newman's comments.
       Regent Richner said, "This is bittersweet. We are grateful you will be with us
for another 15 months. Your record speaks for itself, and the university has excelled
under your leadership. Thank you."
       Regent Darlow said that she looks forward to these next months, and is grateful
that the Coleman's will be staying in the area.
       President Coleman then announced a supplemental agenda item, saying, "One
of the great joys of being president is interacting with our donors, who have such a deep
love of the University. Charles Munger was a Michigan undergraduate before leaving
campus to serve in World War II. He currently is the vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway
and has made generous gifts to support the Law School. The current renovation under
way at the Lawyers Club is thanks to his gift of $20 million."
       And now a new extraordinary gift of $110 million is given to fund a new
Central Campus residence complex. This is the largest gift in the University's history.
This new facility will accommodate 600 students in a highly collaborative setting, and
includes $10 million to endow fellowships for graduate students. She thanked Mr.
Munger deeply for this transformative gift.
       Regent Newman said that the regents had the opportunity to meet with Mr.
Munger when they were in Los Angeles in January, and that he is extraordinary, as is
his vision. This will set Michigan apart as the only university with dedicated, crossdiscipline graduate housing.
       On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Ilitch, the regents
unanimously approved: the designation of the new graduate residential apartment
building as the Munger Graduate Residences; the acquisition of properties at 535 and
537 South Division Street, and 401 and 409 East Madison Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan
as described; the New Graduate Residential Apartment Building project as described,
including commissioning Integrated Design Solutions LLC in association with
Hartman-Cox Architects for its design; and the adoption of the resolution regarding
eminent domain for parcels 541 and 543 as presented.
       President Coleman said that Vice President Harper had an additional
supplemental agenda item on university unions and recreational sports facilities.


292



~


April Meeting, 2013


       Vice President Harper presented a request for approval of a student fee as part
of a comprehensive funding package to renovate the university unions and the
recreational sports facilities. Dr. Loren Rullman, associate vice president for student
affairs, outlined the role of these buildings in the life of the university, and their
worthiness in terms or investment and renovation. The projections are for a $173
million project with funding shared evenly by students and other university sources to
be reflective of the use by all campus stakeholders.
       Vice President Churchill called on those who had signed up for public comment
on this agenda item. The regents heard from the following students: Alexander G.
Abdun-Nabi, student, on unions and recreational sports facilities and renovations;
Caroline Canning, student, on renovations to the Michigan Union; Corey Walsh,
student, on union and recreational sports renovations.
       Regent Ilitch said that she enthusiastically supports this, and that hearing the
strong student support behind this made a difference in her decision-making.
       Regent Darlow said she was glad that the proposal ensures that students
receiving need based financial aid would have this fee included in their financial aid
package.
       Regent Newman said that while she was initially "very interested in renovating
the student recreation centers, and commended the university, and thought there was a
plan to do that without adding a student fee. The plan presented included recreational
facilities and the unions and a fee of $65 per semester, and $130 per year for every
student, with no choice." She said that her concern is that there are many areas on
campus that need repair, and that she would be remiss to support a fee on students for
30 years, while feeling it may have been accomplished in a different way. She added
that a vote on tuition will be coming up, and she "expects to see all the students present
to support increasing tuition as well, in order to maintain the academic quality." She
concluded by saying she is "not in favor of raising mandatory student fee. If there were
a choice I would be more comfortable. Having no choice is just like tuition, and
because there is no choice I will vote against it."
       Regent Bernstein said that he support this, and is grateful for the broad and deep
support among students to bring these facilities up to date.
       Regent Diggs said that she was supportive of this project and happy to see the
connection between living, social activities and academics.
       On a motion by Regent Ilitch, seconded by Regent White, the regents approved
the University Unions and Recreational Sports Facility Improvement Fee of $65 per
term beginning FY 2015, with Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Diggs, Ilitch and White
voting in favor, and Regents Newman and Richner opposed.
       Next, Dr. John Greden, executive director of the U-M Depression Centers
provided an update on the center that was established by the board in 2001, and has
become a national model for research, treatment and education.

April Meeting, 2013


Presentation: "UM Depression Center update"
       Dr. Greden, acknowledged his colleagues from the center, and spoke to the
great value they bring in their collaborative approach. He said that he appreciates the
encouragement the center receives from the university. Few places are poised to
address these complex needs associated with depression, and The Depression Center's
integrative approach.
       President Coleman introduced Professor Kim Kearfott, SACUA chair, to give
the annual report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs.
       Dr. Kearfott said that faculty governance has been an evolution and a revolution
this year, with participation in SACUA moving gradually and consistently forward.
She spoke to the accomplishments such as expanding inclusion of a wide range of
faculty members, and the addition of committees, and committee participation, saying
that it was a very productive year.
Committee Reports
       Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White, chair of the
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, said that she and Regents Bernstein and
Richner, and President Coleman met with Executive Vice President Slottow. The
committee received an update on the Athletic Department FY 2014 budget from
Athletic Director Dave Brandon, via conference call, and Jim Balgooyen, executive

       Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted 11 faculty retirement
memoirs.

       Richard Abel, Ph.D., Robert Altman Collegiate Professor of Film Studies and
professor of international film and media in the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2013.
       Richard Abel received his B.A. degree from Utah State University in 1963, and
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Southern California in 1965 and
1970, respectively. From 1970-2002, he served on the faculty of Drake University. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as the Robert Altman Collegiate Professor of
Film Studies and professor of international film and media in 2002.
       A leading figure of early cinema studies, Professor Abel possessed a unique
dual expertise in both French and American film culture. His critical monographs and
2-volume sourcebook of early critical and theoretical writings opened the world of
silent French cinema to English-speaking scholars. He also studied the circulation of
French cinema in the U.S. before focusing on the relationship between American film
and print culture. He served as editor of the Encyclopedia of Early Cinema (2005) and
the   forthcoming Critical  Concepts  in  Media   and   Cultural  Studies:  Early
Cinema (2013). He received the prestigious Theatre Library Association Award for
best book in film (1985, 1995, and 2005), the National Endowment for the Humanities
Fellowship for College Teachers (1983 and 2001), a John Simon Guggenheim
Memorial Foundation fellowship (1993), and a National Endowment for the
Humanities Fellowship (2011). He served as president of the Society for Cinema
Studies from 1987-89.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Richard Abel
professor emeritus of international film and media.

       Peter M. Bauland, Ph.D., associate professor of English language and
literature in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 2013.
       Professor Bauland received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1953, 1955, and 1964, respectively. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1964 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1969.
       Professor Bauland' s research focused on film studies, modern drama, modern
comparative literature, and translations, with a special emphasis on German and
American T heater. H e authored The Hooded Eagle: German Drama on the New York
Stage (1968) and Gerhart Hauptmann 's Before Daybreak: A translation and an
Introduction (1978) and a 1977 translation of Arthur Schnitzler' s novella The Judge's

Wife (1925). Professor Bauland taught popular courses on drama, film study, comedy,
Shakespeare, comparative modern literature, screenwriting, and playwriting. His
professional and community service includes several posts for Fulbright programs, the
International Exchange of Scholars, the Midwest Modern Language Association, the
Michigan Theater, and numerous appearances as an actor on stage, screen, television,
and radio. Professor Bauland has received distinguished fellowships from the
Fulbright-Hays Program, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Horace
H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
Peter M. Bauland associate professor emeritus of English language and literature.

       Frederick D. Becchetti Jr., Ph.D., professor of physics in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2013.
       Professor Becchetti received his B.Phys., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of Minnesota in 1965, 1968, and 1969, respectively. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1973, and was promoted to
associate professor in 1976, and professor in 1983.
       Professor Becchetti's research focused on heavy-ion nuclear physics and the
development and use of large superconducting ion-optical magnet systems. Professor
Becchetti and G.W. Greenlees developed the widely used Becchetti-Greenlees optical
model parameterization for light ion scattering and transfer reactions at the University
of Minnesota in the 1960's. His instrumentation innovations continued with the use of
superconducting solenoids as focusing elements for rare isotopes and his work to
improve detectors. These improvements have been used in nuclear physics studies
including nuclei near the edge of stability and in measurements applicable to nuclear
medicine. More recently, Professor Becchetti has been developing techniques to
provide magnetic confinement of the dose from electron and x-ray beams used in
cancer therapy. His use of inverse kinematics has allowed measurements of cross
sections of interest in astrophysics which otherwise would not be accessible. An
outstanding teacher, scholar, and scientist, Professor Becchetti has received grants from
many sponsoring agencies and has cultivated deep interest in educating students
through the Department's Physics Olympiad, Undergraduate Research Opportunity
Program, and his countless contributions to the Saturday Morning Physics outreach
program.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher, scholar, and scientist by
naming Frederick D. Becchetti Jr. professor emeritus of physics.

       Richard D. Cureton, Ph.D., associate professor of English language and
literature in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active
faculty status on May 31, 2013.
       Professor Cureton received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1973, 1976, and 1980, respectively. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1985 and was
promoted to associate professor in 1991.
       Professor Cureton' s research focused on the temporal and linguistic rhythmic
hierarchies of poetry, integrating and systematizing the work of contemporary


339



~


May Meeting, 2013


musicology and linguistics. Against the received view of meter as a linguistic
regularization of stress prominences and tone units, he argued that, like time in music,
meter is essentially gestural-a non-linguistic rhythmic pattern upon which a linguistic
hierarchy of phonological, lexical, syntactic, and thematic rhythms is arranged to
produce poetic form. Professor Cureton explicated his theory of poetics in Rhythmic
Phrasing in English Verse (1992), and he variously applied, elaborated, and expanded
this theory in numerous book entries, articles, reviews, responses, and conference
papers.
       Professor Cureton taught undergraduate courses in English language, poetics,
and poetry, many of these on individual authors. He mentored independent study at the
undergraduate and graduate levels, served on a number of departmental committees,
and participated in the ongoing intellectual work of several national and international
associations. He has been a constant advocate for the use of poetic texts in language
instruction and for the development of coherent theoretical models of poetic form.
       The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher and researcher by naming
Richard D. Cureton associate professor emeritus of English language and literature.

       Dee W. Edington, Ph.D., professor of kinesiology in the School of Kinesiology
and research scientist in the School of Public Health, will retire from active faculty
status on May 31, 2013.

1959, his M.S. degree from Florida State University in 1963, and his Ph.D. degree from
Michigan State University in 1968. He served on the faculty of the University of
Massachusetts from 1969-76. Professor Edington joined the University of Michigan
faculty as a professor and chair of the Department of Physical Education in the School
of Education in 1976. He was appointed research scientist in the School of Public
Health in 1984.
       Professor Edington distinguished himself by his innovative and pioneering
translational research on workplace and occupational health management utilizing costeffective methods. A successful research scientist, he published his findings in a wide
array of journals and presented at numerous conferences. Under Professor Edington's
leadership the Department of Physical Education was transformed into the separate
Division of Physical Education and later renamed the Division of Kinesiology (now the
School of Kinesiology). He oversaw the programmatic evolution of the Division from
a focus on physical education professional preparation to the broadly defined field of
kinesiology. These changes led to a doubling of student enrollment and research
funding. Professor Edington is the recipient of several awards and honors including the
Vern Seefeldt Lifetime Achievement Award from the Governor's Council on Physical
Fitness, Health and Sports (2001), the Michigan State University's Distinguished
Alumni Career Award Kinesiology (2008), and the American College of Preventive
Medicine's Distinguished Katharine Boucot Sturgis Award (2009).
       The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher, researcher, and administrator
for his dedicated service by naming Dee W. Edington professor emeritus of kinesiology
and research scientist emeritus.

       Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted one faculty memorial for Beth
N. Diamond, M.L.A., assistant professor of landscape architecture and assistant
professor of art and design, and offered condolences to her family and colleagues.

        The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound
sadness the death of Beth N. Diamond, M.L.A., assistant professor of landscape
architecture in the School of Natural Resources and Environment and assistant
professor of art and design in the Penny W. Stamps School of Art and Design.
Professor Diamond died on April 29, 2013, after a courageous battle with cancer.
         Professor Diamond received her B.A. degree from Friends World College,
Long Island University in 1990, and her B.L.A. and M.L.A. degrees from the
University of Oregon in 1995 and 1997, respectively. She served on the faculty of the
University of Oregon (1998), the University of Kentucky (1999-2002), and California
Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (2002-05). Professor Diamond joined
the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 2005.
         Professor Diamond's scholarly work explored the power of landscape
architecture to interactively engage viewers, galvanize public discourse, and
reinvigorate social and community cohesion. She sought to critically examine the role
of public space design in democratic societies, human social relations, and cross
cultural communications. A gifted teacher and dedicated mentor, Professor Diamond
challenged her students to discover and practice the aesthetic, environmental, and
societal elements of landscape design. She combined coursework and community
outreach with projects in Detroit's Heidelberg neighborhood and Ann Arbor's Nichols
Arboretum. Her courses on the history and theory of landscape design encouraged both
landscape architecture students and Program in the Environment students to view
design from the perspectives of indigenous peoples, minority and working class
populations, and women to understand their own familial landscape heritage.

JUNE MEETING, 2013


                                                        The University of Michigan
                                                                        Ann Arbor

       The regents met at 3:12 p.m. in the Anderson Room, Michigan Union. Present
were President Coleman and Regents Bernstein, Darlow, Deitch, Diggs, Ilitch,
Newman and Richner. Regent White was present for a portion of the meeting via

President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Chancellor Little, Vice President Lynch, Vice
President May, Chancellor Person, Executive Vice President Pescovitz, Provost
Pollack, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow and Vice President
Wilbanks.
Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
       President Coleman said that the June meeting traditionally marks the
nomination of a new chair and vice chair of the Board. She thanked Regent Larry
Deitch for his leadership as chair this past year, and Regent Andrea Fisher Newman for
her contribution as vice chair.
       She announced the selection of a new executive director of the University's
Division of Public Safety and Security, Eddie Washington Jr., who has served as
director of the Michigan State Police, and as a Homeland Security consultant. With the
Board's approval in July he will begin July 23. She noted that the agenda includes
budget presentations from all three campuses, as well as proposals for housing, athletics
and the health system, with an overarching objective of the continued excellence of the
University. This includes making our remarkable academic environment available to all
students by continuing to provide strong financial aid packages to those in need.
       President Coleman thanked Provost Martha Pollack and her team for their work
on the budget, and then turned to Regent Deitch for comments on his last meeting as
chair.
       Regent Deitch provided an update on the Presidential Search as follows: "The
selection of a President is the most important responsibility of the Board of Regents.
We appreciate that President Coleman has given us a good amount of time prior to her
retirement, to carefully plan for an excellent search process and we've already begun
that work. We have had the chance to talk with several firms and have selected Russell
Reynolds Associates to assist the board with our next presidential search. Russell
Reynolds is one of the leading executive recruiting firms in the world with offices in 26
countries. They have a very strong higher education practice, focusing on the
recruitment of presidents, provosts and deans primarily at AAU research universities
and their peers. We last worked with Russell Reynolds in a presidential search when
the Regents hired President Bollinger. The lead members of the Russell Reynolds team
this time are Ilene Nagel, and Alison Ranney. We were impressed by the team's insight
as we discussed the challenges and opportunities in leading one of the world's great
universities. Our consultants are highly regarded by their clients for their effectiveness


353



~


June Meeting, 2013


and the ability to understand the culture and needs of great research universities like
Michigan. We believe our consultants will bring great energy to this important task.
The Regents are united in our commitment to bring in another great president to Ann
Arbor. This has been and will continue to be a team effort. Later this summer we will
have more details on the search process hammered out and we will advise you
accordingly."
       Regent Deitch thanked his colleagues, particularly the committee chairs:
Regent White, chair of the Finance, Audit, and Investment Committee, who developed
valuable expertise in the University finances; Regent Ilitch, chair of the Personnel,
Compensation and Governance Committee, who brought her wisdom and common
sense to the role; and Regent Darlow, chair of the Health Affairs Committee. He said
"I have not observed anyone in my years here who undertook at task with more
devotion to the duty, with a greater sense of commitment, a willingness to apply her
expertise, and to dig for answers on things until she was satisfied. We all owe her a
debt of gratitude."
       Regent Deitch continued, saying "the Regents' Bylaws state that the positions
of chair and vice chair rotate based on seniority until all members of the board have had
the opportunity to serve as chair or vice chair. Therefore, I move the nomination of
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman as chair of the Board of Regents and Regent Katherine
White as vice chair of the Board of Regents, effective July 1, 2013 through June 30,
2014." The motion was seconded by Ilitch and carried unanimously.
       President Coleman then turned to Executive Vice President and CFO Tim
Slottow for his presentation on the financial health of the University.
Budget Presentations:
       Executive Vice President Slottow said that his report provides context for the
budgets that are on the agenda for approval by focusing on the University's balance
sheet, along with opportunities and threats that affect the major assets and liabilities.
Fundamental to protecting the overall financial health of the University is the ability to
adhere to sound financial principals, including a disciplined operating budget strategy,
focus on cost controls, diversity in revenue streams, long-range capital investment
strategies, excellent management of the endowment, and conservative utilization of
debt. Added to this are strong internal controls that includes a robust unit certification
program process for all financial activities, resulting in improved compliance. He
reviewed the balance sheet saying that the ratio of total assets to total liabilities is very
healthy, as are total financial assets and debt. A majority of the financial assets are
restricted, but support core operations. One liability that does not appear on the balance
sheet is the fully depreciated buildings of about $600 million in deferred maintenance.
He said aggressive efforts to grow the endowment to support the general fund led to the
development of $13 million in recurring new dollars to support financial aid,
professorships, and global student experiences. This, combined with the success of the
Development team, has resulted in $233 million annually being spun-off from the
endowment to support the General Fund. Planning includes an ongoing commitment
to renew and replace facilities as necessary, improve operating costs, and enhance
sustainability in terms of energy usage and more efficient construction standards.

June Meeting, 2013


       Finally, Vice President Slottow said that human assets are the most valuable
asset, and require continuous investment including programs like MHealthy, and health
benefit improvements.  In terms of liabilities, the University has a prudent debt
management policy with $1,796 million in debt as of April 30, 2013, and the highest
possible AAA credit rating from both Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors
Service. The proposed budgets continue to support the overall financial health of the
institution.
       Provost Pollack presented the proposed Ann Arbor FY2013-14 General Fund
Operating Budget, student tuition and fee rates. She thanked the budget team saying
that the budget is true to the mission, ensures academic excellence, invests in financial
aid, and aggressively contains costs while seeking new revenues.
       Provost Pollack said, "This budget protects our faculty and helps us recruit and
retain the kind of faculty that make Michigan great." It also protects the academic
resources such as the diverse collections at our libraries that serve as a resource not just
to the university, but to the whole state of Michigan.
       Provost Pollack spoke of an 'uncommon education' even for those in need of
financial assistance. This budget, for the fifth year in a row, has no net cost of
attendance for those who qualify for financial assistance. For many students net costs
will decrease, and the proposed tuition increase is the lowest in 29 years. Financial aid
to meet the full cost of attendance for out-of-state undergraduates also was expanded to
include families earning up to $40,000/annually, up from $20,000/annually in past
years. Cost containment has taken a three-pronged approach, including aggressively
controlling costs, targeting philanthropic priorities, and developing recurring alternative
revenue sources resulting in a total of $265 million. This year's general fund budget
includes $24 million in reductions, such as the IT rationalization program, staff
efficiencies, and energy conservation mechanisms.
       The recommended increase for FY 2014 for undergraduate in-state tuition is
$148/year which is a 1.1% increase; the out-of-state increase is $1,270/year or 3.2%.
Graduate tuition has a proposed 1.8% increase across the board.
       Provost Pollack concluded by saying, "we want to continue to provide an
'uncommon education' and we will do so. We will continue to invest in the programs
that make our students leaders for the 21st century.
       Chancellor Little presented the proposed Dearborn Campus FY 2013-14
General Fund Operating Budget, student tuition and fee rates, with the number one
priority of maintaining and expanding the academic quality of the education offered at
UM-Dearborn. He said there is growth in the health professions programs offered to
students, which are in high demand. This budget will preserve accessibility to every
student, including high numbers of both Pell Grant eligible students, and first
generation college students. It also will help assure UM-Dearborn continues to be a fair
and productive learning environment for all of the faculty and staff. Budget highlights
include a 10% increase in financial aid, a 2% increase in faculty and staff salaries, new
student life programs complementing the new private housing programs, and
renovations for infrastructure. Cost containment efforts include $3.4 million in cost
elimination, with another $500,000 projected in the current year. Chancellor Little's


355

June Meeting, 2013


recommendation includes a tuition and fee increase for undergraduate and graduate
student of 3.5% for residents and 2.0% for non-residents.
       Chancellor Person resented the proposed UM-Flint Campus FY 2013-14
General Fund Operating Budget, student tuition and fee rates. She said her budget
priorities include a planned investment in enrollment management, improved retention
and graduation rates, and new program development. This includes planned growth in
international and veteran students, and in dual enrollment programs. Other priorities
are a commitment to energy savings, infrastructure, financial aid, faculty and staff.
Chancellor Person's budget recommendation includes a 3.5% increase for resident and
non-resident undergraduates, and a 3.0% increase for graduate students. Chancellor
Person added that the UM-Flint residence hall rates are proposed to increase by 2.7%.
       Vice President Harper commented on the renovation of many of the residence
halls that greatly improved the student experience. She said that investment in facilities
requires good management of resources. She presented the proposed 2013-14
University Housing Residence Hall rates for the Ann Arbor Campus as an increase of
2.5%, and an increase of 0.5% for Northwood Community Apartment rates. She added
that fee assessments for Central Student Government, Student Legal Services, and
school/college governments would all remain unchanged from 2012-13 rates.
       UMHHC Chief Executive Officer Doug Strong presented the University of
Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers FY 2014 Operating Budget, and commented on
the strategic plan created with the Regents, which positions UMHS for future success
across all components of the mission: research, education, and patient care. He noted
continued strong patient care and the impact of major developments such as the

June Meeting, 2013


Comments from Regents
       Regent Hitch thanked the administration for doing a great job. She continued
saying "It's my position that the business model must change. If we have heard it once
we've heard numerous times that the continuing raising of tuition is not sustainable and
that this business model is not sustainable, so I am going to continue to encourage us to
change. I acknowledge that this is not a university problem. This is a national
problem. We have heard over and over as we have talked to different professionals in
this area that this is a challenge that all of higher education is facing.
       "It was an interesting statistic to me that resident tuition has increased 63% in
the past 10 years. I want to encourage us to continue to focus on creating revenue
streams, to centralize more functions for optimum efficiency, to invest more, and to
centralize fund raising and development. If we were as good at raising revenue streams
as we are at raising tuition our students would be far better off, access to higher
education would be easier for many, and students would not be crushed by debt. I was
struck by some statistics that have impacted our students when it comes to debt both on
a national level and on a local level. On a national basis Americans are carrying more
than $1 trillion of college debt. So to give a perspective to this, students at Michigan's
15 public universities took out nearly $2 billion in student loans in the 2009-10 year.
Students at Michigan's four-year public universities carry and average loan debt of
$26,000 ranking our state the 12th highest in the nation. As we review the budgets and
talk about the fact that it's the lowest tuition increase in many years, many would say
that's not much of an increase, but as one Michigan student said, when you don't have
much to begin with it adds up fast. We have increased tuition 29 years in a row. I
would like to encourage all of us, I would like to be part of the solution, to show more
creativity in raising revenue streams, and more discipline fiscally, and to use a
wonderful phrase that Provost Pollack said ' a relentless commitment' to stop raising
tuition on our Michigan students."
       Regent Richner, commended Provost Pollack on her excellent work in keeping
tuition the lowest increase in 29 years and agreed with Regent Ilitch's comments. "I'm
going to vote for the tuition increase. Nobody likes tuition increases, me in particular,
but I believe the budgets we have before us today will assure we are able to maintain
the level of quality and excellence that our students expect and deserve."
       Regent White said "I support the budget and recognize how hard the
administration has been working to keep the quality of the UM at it's highest, and also
try to keep it as affordable as possible."

ï~~JULY MEETING, 2007

The University ofMichigan
Ann Arbor
July 19, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill,
Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Acting Chancellor Kay, Vice President
Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She noted that Regent Taylor
and Regent White had assumed their positions as chair and vice chair, respectively, of
the Board on July 1, and said she looked forward to working with them in these roles.
President Coleman also commented that this would be the last meeting Vice
President Marvin Krislov would attend before leaving the University to assume the
position of president of Oberlin College. She noted that in his role as vice president
and general counsel, Vice President Krislov had crafted and led the successful defense
of the University's admissions practices before the U.S. Supreme Court, for which the
University and higher education in general would always be extremely grateful. She
called on Regent Deitch.
Regents Resolution in Honor of Marvin Krislov
Regent Deitch called Vice President Krislov to the podium, noting "Marvin is a
very fine lawyer, and more importantly than that, a very fine man. And we will miss
him." He then read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend Marvin
Krislov as he steps down from his position as vice president and general
counsel on August 3, 2007 to become president of Oberlin College.
Vice President Krislov joined the University ofMichigan in 1998
as the first person to hold the title of vice president and general counsel.
With his keen intelligence, deeply held values, and passionate
commitment to social justice and academic integrity, he has clearly set a
high bar for his successors. His leadership of the University's legal
defense of its admissions policies, which resulted in the historic 2003
Supreme Court decision establishing the constitutionality of diversity
considerations in college and university admissions, and his subsequent
role in shaping the University's actions in response to the decision, are
seminal achievements. He has also made significant contributions to
policy development in the full panoply of issues that face universities in
the 21st century -- issues as far ranging as athletics, financial aid, labor



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

standards, human rights, academic freedom, and the dissemination of
knowledge for the public good in this digital era.
Vice President Krislov's broad interests and values are also
reflected in his University and community service. He served as co-chair
of the president's Ethics in Public Life initiative and is on the steering
committee of the Center for Institutional Diversity. He serves on the
board of directors of the University Musical Society and of the United
Way of Washtenaw County, and chaired the most recent University of
Michigan United Way campaign. An adjunct professor at the Law
School and in the Department of Political Science, he is a popular
teacher and mentor.
With his exceptional record of accomplishments, leadership, and
service, Vice President Krislov has left a remarkable legacy at the
University of Michigan. The Regents express their deep gratitude to
Marvin Krislov for his dedicated service and send him all best wishes as
he assumes his new role.
A standing ovation followed.
Vice President Krislov commented that it was very emotional for him "to
consider leaving this wonderful place." He thanked the Board for taking the nearly
unprecedented steps of "making decisions on the basis of principle and moral
conviction, and taking risks," and thanked the Board for its steadfast commitment to
values and principles. He also thanked President Coleman and other presidents with
whom he served, along with his fellow executive officers and his colleagues in the
Office of the Vice President and General Counsel. He concluded by stating that '"this is
an amazing place, and the fact that I've been privileged to be here is one of the greatest
honors of my life."
Resolution in Honor of Juan Mestas
President Coleman announced that Juan Mestas would be stepping down as
chancellor of the University of Michigan-Flint after leading the campus for eight years.
Following a sabbatical, he will return as special advisor to the chancellor and the
provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs. She called on Regent Maynard.
Regent Maynard called Chancellor Mestas to the podium. She noted that a few
days ago, almost 700 people had gathered for the groundbreaking for the campus's first
residence hall. This outpouring represented an appreciation for all that Chancellor
Mestas has done, not just for the University of Michigan-Flint, but also for the city of
Flint. She read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan commend Juan E.
Mestas as he steps down from the position of chancellor of the University
of Michigan-Flint to become special advisor to the chancellor and to the
provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs.
From the moment he arrived on the Flint campus almost eight
years ago, Chancellor Mestas immediately captivated the campus and



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

community with his friendly, warm, and engaging demeanor. A scholar
and teacher of Hispanic languages and literature and former deputy
chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, his humane and
forthright style brought a  sense of greater transparency   and
accountability to administrative decision-making on the Flint campus.
As chancellor, Juan worked diligently to protect and steward the
Flint campus' resources during periods of severe budget constraints.
During his tenure, the William S. White Building was completed,
creating an important bridge over the Flint River to the broader
community. He oversaw the creation of the highly effective Women's
Educational Center and the establishment of the Doctor of Physical
Therapy program, the first doctoral program on the Flint campus. Most
recently, and  largely through the force of Juan's passionate
determination and persistence, the campus' first student housing
complex is underway. It promises to further enhance the campus' vitality
and become the centerpiece of his legacy.
Few campus administrators exude the unique blend of charm,
urbanity, and wit that make Chancellor Mestas such a charismatic,
engaging, and effective leader. It is in this spirit that the Regents are
pleased to name Juan E. Mestas chancellor emeritus of the University of
Michigan-Flint.
A standing ovation followed, after which Chancellor Mestas thanked President
Coleman and the Regents and said that he looked forward to returning to campus after
his nine-month leave.
President's Opening Remarks. President Coleman announced that Professor
Hyman Bass, the Roger C. Lyndon Collegiate Professor of Mathematics and professor
of mathematics in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and professor of
education in the School of Education, has been awarded the 2006 National Medal of
Science, the nation's highest scientific honor.
President Coleman invited all to attend the campus-wide memorial service on
July 27 for the Survival Flight crew and transplant team that perished on June 4th while
on a medical mission.
President Coleman said that the 2007-2008 budgets and tuition rates would be
considered at this meeting, even though the budget will be finalized without the state
appropriation having been finalized. She noted that the recommended undergraduate
tuition increase of 7.4% is being made with extreme sensitivity to the needs of students
and their families, and is among the lowest of all of the state universities this year. She
pointed out that expense reductions planned in the proposed FY2008 General Fund
budget totaled more than $21 million, and that the proposed budget calls for an increase
in undergraduate financial aid of 11.5%, which underscores the University's continued
commitment to meet the full financial need of qualified in-state undergraduate students.
She commented that request for adoption of this budget is being done with the
knowledge of the tremendous value that the state's leaders place on an educated
citizenry. Despite the difficult budget challenges faced by the state's policy makers in



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

the current environment, President Coleman expressed confidence that lawmakers and
citizens understand the importance of investing in higher education and of the
University's role in transforming Michigan's economy.
Public Comments on Agenda-Related Topics
The Regents heard comments from the following people, all on the topic of
proposed tuition increases: Travis Radina, student, Fannie Weinstein, student, and
Stephen Pontoni, student, on tuition increases, and David Boyle, alumnus, on military
family tuition issues.
2007-2008 Operating Budgets - All Campuses
Executive Vice President Slottow presented the annual report of the chief
financial officer. He noted that the balance sheet is protected by two fundamental
things: sound financial policies, including those concerning debt, the spending rule,
renewal of capital planning, and the discipline of balanced budgets with recurring cost
reductions and revenues; and by strong internal control structures. He said that with
oversight by the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee, significant progress is
being made in strengthening internal controls, including launching of a compliance
hotline and increased controls and oversight of the P-card program.
Regarding the balance sheet, he reported that the relationship of assets to
liabilities is strong and appropriate, as is the relation of debt to financial assets. Threats
to the balance sheet include the future liabilities of post-retirement health benefits that
will be booked for the first time in 2008, and $100-$500 million in deferred
maintenance of buildings and infrastructure. He also pointed out that the majority of
the University's non-hospital financial assets are in the form of endowments with use
restrictions.
Regarding the financial assets in the balance sheet, Executive Vice President
Slottow noted that in the area of short-term financial assets, proactive cash management
measures have enabled the treasurer's office to accumulate over $700,000 in savings
during the past year. The endowment, which totaled $5.7 billion in 2006, provides a
distribution equal to 4.2%  of the University's operating revenues, and primarily
supports financial aid, faculty, and academic programs.
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that in response to a challenge set
forth by Regent Newman, the President's Challenge was created, and it has provided
$90 million in additional endowment for the General Fund to support need-based
financial aid and professorships. A second phase has been planned to add to this
endowment, and combined with revenues received from the Big Ten television
contract, this endowment will total about $200 million, providing $9.5 - $10.5 million
in recurring financial aid and faculty support.
He displayed a chart illustrating the University's commitment to renewal of the
physical plant, and concluded that, with the elimination of about $200 million in
deferred maintenance in recent years, appropriate attention is being paid to this area.
He pointed out that about 320,000 hours of maintenance is conducted each year, with
15% of this time being spent on preventive maintenance.



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

Executive Vice President Slottow reported that significant, ongoing efforts are
being directed toward improving information technology security. He briefly reviewed
the University's human capital, noting that the University employs a higher percentage
of minorities than the state and local workforce does, and that the University's regular
staff contains a significantly higher percentage of women employees than does the state
and local region. Noting that 65% of the University's budget is devoted to salaries and
benefits, he listed programs underway to maintain a loyal, healthy, and productive
workforce.
Regarding liabilities, Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the
University continues to enjoy the highest possible credit rating from Standard & Poor's
and Moody's, and the cost of debt has been reduced to 4.2% from 4.3% last year.
Through the University's captive insurance company we have successfully reduced
operating expenses by $14 million per year over the last 8 years.
Executive Vice President Slottow concluded that the proposed budget is
consistent with maintaining the University's overall financial health, and quoted from
Standard & Poor's April 2007 analysis, that "UM is one of three U.S. public
universities that have an 'AAA' rating from Standard & Poor's...a national reputation
for excellence in academics/research and a national draw for students...diverse revenue
streams...strong financial liquidity...solid financial performance... manageable debt
burden and 10-year capital plan...exceptional record of fund raising."
Ann Arbor Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee
Rates
Provost Sullivan reported that the proposed current funds, all campuses budget
for 2007-08 will increase from about $4.9 billion to about $4.979 billion, with total
expenditures of about $4.923 billion.
She noted that the General Fund represents 28% of the total current funds
budget on the Ann Arbor campus, and its revenues are derived from three main sources:
state appropriation, tuition and fees, and indirect cost recovery on sponsored research
activity. Regarding the state appropriation, the figures being presented are predicated
on the assumptions that the University will receive $320 million, the same amount
received during the current fiscal year, and that the University will receive a promised
payment in October. If the finalized appropriation turns out to be significantly less, it
will be necessary to revisit the issue with the Board.
Provost Sullivan pointed out that in addition to the General Fund, the
University's operating funds are made up of the Designated Fund, about 3% of the total
operating fund, the Expendable Restricted Fund, representing about 18% of the total
operating fund, and the Auxiliary Activities Fund (including the Hospitals and Health
System and Intercollegiate Athletics), which comprises about 50% of the total Ann
Arbor campus operating fund.
Provost Sullivan stated that the University's budget priorities are student access
(maintaining the commitment to meet the demonstrated financial need of all Michigan
resident undergraduate students), maintaining excellence in research and scholarship,
and serving as responsible stewards by increasing efficiencies and reallocating funds to
the highest priority uses. She enumerated some of the key initiatives planned for fiscal



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

year 2008, which include improving student access, enhancing undergraduate education
by instituting two new undergraduate majors in public policy and informatics, faculty
recruitment and retention, in addition to funding for the arts, and for library
acquisitions, investments in infrastructure, and technology transfer activities.
Provost Sullivan noted that over the past four years, there have been cost
reductions and reallocations totaling $95.7 million, and the current plan assumes an
additional reallocation of $21.3 million (1.6%). She described several significant longterm cost containment efforts that are underway in the schools and colleges and in
central administration. She also displayed a chart indicating the decreasing proportion
of state appropriation in the General Fund, from almost 80% in 1960 to 24% projected
for 2008, with student fees increasing from 20% to 62% of the General Fund during
that time. It was noted that internal cost reductions have been essential to the
University's maintaining its quality during this time period.
The recommended tuition increases for FY2008 for the Ann Arbor campus, for
both residents and nonresidents, are 7.4% for undergraduates and 5.0% for most
graduate students. She compared the FY2008 tuition and fee rates with those of other
Big Ten institutions and with other Michigan public institutions, and compared the
University's tuition for a Michigan resident and Michigan nonresident with those for
Michigan's peer private universities. The recommended General Fund budget includes
over $99 million for centrally-awarded financial aid, an increase of 9.0% over the
previous year, with additional financial aid available from non-General Fund sources
and from the individual schools and colleges.
The recommended General Fund budget for FY2008 is $1,347,661,000, an
increase of 4. 1% over the previous year.
Dearborn Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee
Rates
Chancellor Little reported that the budget priorities for the Dearborn campus are
academic excellence, student access, and creating a highly productive and equitable
work environment on the campus.    He said the budget was developed on the
assumption of a flat appropriation for the coming year, but if the appropriation should
decrease, this budget would need to be revisited. The recommended UM-Dearborn
General Fund budget for 2007-08 includes a tuition increase of 7.9% for resident
undergraduates and 5% increase for resident graduate students. The budget includes a
16% increase in institutionally-funded financial aid and a 3% faculty and staff salary
program.
Flint Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Interim Chancellor Kay commented that as campus leaders were putting
together the 2007-08 General Fund budget, they received a great deal of input regarding
the difficult economic conditions in the Flint area. Because the UM-Flint does not have
the resources to guarantee 100% of student financial need, campus leadership was
asked to exercise tuition restraint. The other strong operating principle was to do
nothing that would have a negative impact on the excellent education available at the
University of Michigan-Flint. Accordingly, the UM-Flint is requesting a combined
tuition and fee increase of 6.4% for resident undergraduate students and 5% for



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

graduate students. This budget assumes a flat undergraduate enrollment and a 3%
increase in graduate enrollment, a 3% merit salary program, and an increase of 8.4% in
institutional financial aid, (2% above the combined tuition and fee increase), along with
budget cuts and reallocations.
2007-2008 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
Vice President Harper commented that the proposed fee assessments of $7.19
per student per term for MSA, $6.00 per student per term for SLS, and $1.50 per
student per term for school and college governments remain the same as those in effect
during 2006-2007.
FY 2008 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Harper presented a request for a University Health Service fee
increase of 3.2% for FY 2008, yielding a new fee of $160.63 per student per term. The
proposed increase provides funding for operational increases plus a modest amount for
funding of M-Thrive, a coordinated case management system for students struggling
with physical or emotional issues.
Discussion of Budgets and Student Fee Assessments
Regent Taylor pointed out that if the assumptions on which the budgets are
predicated turn out to be incorrect, the Regents will need to revisit these issues.
Regent Newman commented that she appreciates the work that has been done to
use endowment funds to offset costs in the General Fund. However, she noted that
tuition and fees have risen at a far higher rate than the state appropriation during the
time she has been on the Board, meaning that the problem cannot be solved by budget
cutting alone, and that other means need to be found to keep the cost within reach of the
average citizen. She suggested that the solution would be for the board to endorse
establishment of a fund by means of which money could be raised to endow tuition.
Regent Taylor agreed that the situation is becoming increasingly difficult,
noting that currently, the state legislature is merely shifting the responsibility to parents
and students.
However, Regent Newman pointed out that the state budget situation has not
been favorable for a number of years, so as a constitutionally autonomous entity, it is
incumbent upon the University to take responsibility for solving the problem. She
complimented the administration for keeping the tuition increase at a reasonable level
and said she would support the proposed budgets.
President Coleman said that Regent Newman and the rest of the board have
helped encouraged the administration to explore new ways of growing the endowment
in support of the General Fund.
Regent Taylor stated that he believes the legislature does have a responsibility
to provide sufficient funding for higher education. He pointed out that the University
has cut tens of millions of dollars from its budget in recent years, but despite this and
other efforts, revenues need to increase. He believes it is time for the state government
to recognize this and behave accordingly, by raising revenues.



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

Regent Deitch commented that the University is paying the consequences for
the structural change that is occurring in the state. He stated that the board and
administration have been responsible stewards of the institution, and although they are
all fully cognizant of the consequences of tuition increases on families and students,
they have to continually balance efficiency and cost-cutting efforts with their mandate
of maintaining excellence. Regent Deitch pointed out that any solution to the state's
structural problems involves the University of Michigan serving as a key component to
a better and different future. He particularly commended the administrations of the
Dearborn and Flint campuses for providing a great education for their students with
many fewer resources than are available on the Ann Arbor campus.
Regent Darlow agreed with the previous comments, and pointed out that "the
real headline here, beside the tuition increase, is the increase in financial aid, which is
really extraordinary."
Regent McGowan cautioned that the notion of endowing tuition needs to be
vetted through the University's development professionals, "who know our donor base
best, understand what they are prepared to support, and know what course we would
have to take to prepare donors for being asked to underwrite individual families' tuition
in addition to all of the other projects they are already funding at the University." This
needs to happen before the Regents can publicly make a commitment to the idea of
creating an endowment for tuition.
Regents Taylor and Deitch responded that this is only one of many ideas that
can be pursued. Executive Vice President Slottow agreed, noting that this is one of a
portfolio of strategies being considered to address the trend of declining state support of
higher education. He said the administration has prioritized about a dozen rigorous,
high-priority approaches that are being analyzed and pursued. Regent Taylor said that
the General Fund endowment idea needs to be analyzed to see if it is viable.
Regent Richner commented that, although the state legislature has a
responsibility to address its structural problems, the Regents also have a responsibility
to keep tuition rates down. He believes that University has done this with the current
budget and tuition proposal, and he commended the administration, in this very
challenging time, for having come up with "a fairly modest proposal."
Vice President May noted that working on the issue of private support for
tuition requires a lot more time and more analysis, but he would be pleased to explore
these issues going forward.
2007-2008 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets; FY 2008 Ann Arbor
Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent Maynard moved approval of the FY        2007-2008 Revenue and
Expenditure Operating Budgets and the FY 2008 Ann Arbor Campus General Fund
operating budget and student tuition and fee rates. Regent White seconded the motion
and it was approved unanimously.



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

Dearborn Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee
Rates
Regent White moved approval of the FY 2008 Dearborn Campus General Fund
operating budget and student tuition and fee rates. Regent McGowan seconded the
motion and it was approved unanimously.
Flint Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent Maynard moved approval of the FY 2008 Flint Campus General Fund
operating budget and student tuition and fee rates. Regent Taylor seconded the motion
and it was approved unanimously.
2007-2008 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal
Services (SLS), and School/College Governments
Regent White moved approval of the 2007-2008 fee assessments for Michigan
Student Assembly (MSA), Student Legal Services (SLS), and School/College
Governments. Regent Ditch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
FY 2008 University Health Service Fee
Regent White moved approval of the FY 2008 University Health Service Fee.
Regent Deitch seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
President Coleman thanked the Regents for their support of the budget
proposals. Regent McGowan left the meeting at this point.
FY 2008 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Operating Budget
President Coleman called on Mr. Doug Strong, director and chief executive
officer of the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC), to
present the UMHHC FY2008 operating budget. Mr. Strong reported that with the
exception of the Survival Flight tragedy, the UMHHC had had a very successful year in
FY 2007, and he highlighted some of the institution's accomplishments. Objectives for
FY2008 include delivering safe, efficient, high quality care; to increase access and
capacity to permit growth; to continue to improve patient and staff satisfaction; and to
achieve a 3% margin consistent with the long-term financial plan.
Mr. Strong said that the UMHHC would be increasing its inpatient bed capacity
by 14.5% over the next 18 months, and it would also be adding capacity for diagnostics
and procedures. He noted that the FY2008 budget calls for an increase of 5.4% in
inpatient discharges and a 9.5% increase in outpatient activity. The FY2008 budget
forecasts an operating margin of 3.0% ($52.0 million) on a budget of $1.736 billion in
operating revenues (an 11.3% increase over FY2007) and $1.684 billion in total
expenses (12.5% increase).
Mr. Strong concluded that the budget was aggressive, but achievable. Risks
relate to the payer climate. The budget relies on a continued high occupancy rate with
strong patient growth, a more constrained expense budget than in previous years,
successful completion of "CareLink," and implementation of the "Lean Thinking"
model across the organization. Lean Thinking is the application of lean manufacturing
techniques from the auto industry as they apply to health care, with the goal of reducing
waste and increasing productivity by analyzing improving processes.



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

FY 2008 Athletic Department Budget
Mr. Bill Martin, Donald R. Shepherd Director of Athletics, presented the FY
2008 Athletic Department budget. Mr. Martin reported that the department had
enjoyed a very solid year, and that the current economic model, based on the priority
seating program, is sustainable. The work plan includes continued fundraising efforts
for capital projects, executing the premium seating marketing plan for the Michigan
Stadium project and soliciting additional major gifts for this project, and developing
programming to address the needs of Crisler Arena.
Mr. Martin said that the preferred seating program ("PSD") had a 97% retention
rate in FY 2007, and there is a considerable wait list for these seats. PSD program
donations in FY 2007 totaled $11,799,642, and donations have increased every year
since implementation of the program. Mr. Martin reported that FY 2007 operating
revenues are projected to be $83,682,000, exceeding the budgeted amount by 1.8%.
The operating surplus for FY 2007 is projected to be about $13.6 million, about double
the budgeted amount.
The FY 2008 Athletic Department budget projects about $87 million in
revenues and about $74 million in expenses, for a surplus of $13 million. He displayed
a chart illustrating the department's operating surplus over a period of 10 years, during
which it went from a deficit of about $2.5 million in 1998-99 to the current surplus of
more than $13 million.
Regent Taylor commented on the remarkable turnaround that Mr. Martin and
his staff have made, noting that this is one of the few athletic departments that receives
no funding from central administration. The department also provides the maximum
number of scholarships for all sports, whether or not the sport is revenue-generating,
and pays tuition for all scholarship athletes. In addition, the department is contributing
$2 million per year to the central administration for academic purposes.  He
commended the department and its leadership and staff on these accomplishments.
Approval of FY 2008 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Operating
Budget
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the FY 2008 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health
Centers Operating Budget.
Regents' Committee Chairs for 2007-2008
Regent Taylor announced that Regent McGowan would continue to serve as
chair of the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regents Maynard and Deitch
will also serve on this committee.  Regent Richner will serve as chair of the
Compensation, Personnel and Governance Committee, and will be joined on this
committee by Regents Newman and Darlow. As chair and vice chair, respectively, he
and Regent White would serve as ex officio members of both committees.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Maynard reported that
the committee had discussed three issues: the Hospitals and Health Centers strategic
plan and lease portfolio (with Executive Vice President Kelch, UMHHC director and



ï~~July Meeting, 2007

CEO Doug Strong, UMHHC CFO Dave Morlock, and UMHHC COO Tony Denton);
the bimonthly audit update, with University Audits executive director Carol Senneff;
and the Human Capital Report, with Laurita Thomas, associate vice president for
human resources and affirmative action, and Tom Palmer, senior business analyst.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee.      Regent Taylor
reported that the PCG Committee had reviewed the Human Capital Report from Laurita
Thomas and Tom Palmer. He noted that the report indicates there will be a large
number of retirements occurring in the coming years, so a lot of planning needs to be
done to prepare for the turnover. The committee also discussed agenda-setting issues,
and will be assembling data on best practices for the work of committees that serve this
function.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.

runs the risk of possibly pricing some students out of the market. He noted that
students had begun organizing to present the student point of view to state legislators.
He distributed a report from the president of the UM-Dearborn student government.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the Report of Voluntary
Support for June 30, 2007. He said that the full report of voluntary support for Fiscal

The University ofMiehigan
Ann Arbor
September 20, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Interim Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Interim Vice President Hage, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little,
Vice President May, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent Deitch was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She welcomed David Lampe,
vice president for communications, and Gloria Hage, interim vice president and general
counsel, to the meeting, and thanked Vice President Wilbanks for her service as interim
vice president for communications.
President's Opening Remarks. President Coleman noted that the start of the
new academic year has been marked by the award of two significant federal grants.
The first is a $55 million Clinical and Translational Science Award from the NIH, the
largest grant ever received by the Medical School, and the second is a $33 million grant
from the NIH to the Institute for Social Research to extend its 33-year "Monitoring the
Future" study for another five years.
President Coleman commented on the unprecedented academic qualifications of
the new freshman class on the Ann Arbor campus, and noted that both the Dearborn
and Flint campuses have set freshman enrollment records. She commended admissions
officers and faculty for their efforts in achieving these enrollment milestones.
President Coleman reported that Professor Marilyn Mason, University organist
and professor of music in the School of Music, Theatre and Dance, is beginning her
60th year on the faculty this fall, and congratulated her on achieving this remarkable
milestone. She also announced that Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National
Human Genome Research Institute and former Medical School faculty member, would
be the Winter Commencement speaker and Bob Woodruff, ABC News correspondent
and Law School alumnus, would speak at the Spring Commencement.
President Coleman observed that former faculty member, dean, and interim
provost Ned Gramlich had passed away earlier this month. "We all experienced his
gentle demeanor and his warm sense of humor, and I know all of us extend our deepest
sympathies to his wife, Ruth, and their family. We will miss him very, very much."
Letter to President Coleman from the Regents
Regent Taylor, chair of the Board of Regents, announced that he would like to
read the following letter to President Coleman:



ï~~September Meeting, 2007

September 20, 2007
Dr. Mary Sue Coleman, President
University of Michigan
2065 Fleming Administration Building
503 Thompson Street
Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1340
Dear PresidentMary Sue Coleman,
On July 31, 2007, you completed your firstfive-year term as the 13th president of the University
of Michigan. You are now embarking on your second five-year term, which we announced last
summer following a thorough and exhaustive performance review.
By this letter, we celebrate the conclusion of your first term and look forward with great
optimism to the beginning of your next term as president of this great University: The
University of Michigan.
Last year was one of significant challenges and great accomplishments. The passage of
Proposal 2, the surprise announcement by Pfizer Corporation that it is closing its Ann Arbor
facilities, mid-year funding reductions from the state, a struggling economy - these events
inevitably defined some of your priorities for the year. And yet, in each instance, your
leadership and that of the outstanding executive team that you have assembled are making a
positive difference, and this gives us great confidence that the University's prominence and
momentum will continue unabated
Through all of these events and activities, you and your team have always focused on that which
is most important- the academic excellence of the University of Michigan. Your administration
has nurtured an environment and committed resources to attract and retain the best faculty in
academia: Faculty who perform cutting edge research; who win honors for their excellence in
teaching and scholarship; and who work to solve some ofsociety's most vexing problems. And
you are mindful that our extraordinary students are here to acquire the knowledge and
experience they need to become tomorrow's leaders. This academic excellence is what makes
the University ofMichigan one of the greatpublic research institutions in the world
You have worked tirelessly to fulfll our institutional commitment to diversity both before and
after the passage of Proposal 2 - whether by creating the Diversity Blueprints Task Force,
speaking passionately about the value of diversity to the college experience, or personally
recruiting students. Your efforts to create and maintain a diverse campus will be one of the
hallmarks of your presidency.
Your administration also responded swiftly and effectively to the Pfizer announcement You
promptly created a fund for hiring Pfizer employees and offered teacher training programs, and
have been working cooperatively with government officials and Ann Arbor Spark to respond to
what everyone acknowledges is a difficult challenge for the University community and the entire
state.
You are committed to the national and state economy: When you sit on the Steering Committee
of the Council of Competitiveness Energy Security, Innovation and Sustainability Initiative; the
board of directors of Internet2; and the Detroit Renaissance board; and when you collaborate
with the presidents ofMSU and WSU to form the University Research Corridor, you show that
you understand the unique and critical role that U of M plays in transforming our economy.
Your administration's focus on increasing our research partnerships with the private sector has
received extraordinary accolades from industry, and these efforts to bring national attention to
our research enterprise will pay long-term dividends to the University and to the state.  The
opening of the Detroit Center, which extends the University into the community in a way that
benefits both, further demonstrates your administration's commitment to the entire state.
Across campus, a number of successful projects have come to fruition this past year.



ï~~September Meeting, 2007

On the health care front, your excellent health care administrative team led the successful sale
of M-Care to Blue Cross Blue Shield Your administration's innovative health care programs
have received national attention: Pilot programs such as pill splitting and the elimination of
co-pays for diabetes drugs. We were pleased to learn earlier this year that your Michigan
Healthy Community Initiative has transitioned to a permanent central committee to plan and
design future health related programs for faculty and staff
Another initiative, the Residential Life Initiative or "RLI" as it has come to be known, is
enhancing the student lfe experience, as well as the physical look of campus. The new Hill
Dining Center is starting to take shape, while the neighboring Mosher-Jordan and Stockwell
residence halls undergo major renovations. A few blocks away, the Frieze Building has been
cleared and construction has begun on North Quad the first new residence hall in over forty
years. North Quad isn'tjust any residence hall; it combines academic and residential space in
an innovative, state-of-the-art living/learning center that will serve as a model for the future.
And in July the Flint Campus celebrated the groundbreaking of its first residence hall in that
campus's history.
The physical campus is evolving in many ways. This past year, we celebrated the opening of
Weill Hall and the Cardiovascular Center, we broke ground for the new C. S. Mott Children's
and Women's Hospital, construction of the new building for the Stephen M. Ross School of
Business is well underway, and we anticipate with enthusiasm the major additions to the Kelsey
Museum and the Museum of Art's Alumni Memorial Hall. These are just some examples of the
many successful capital projects that are underway or recently completed On the athletic
campus, your team presented successful plans for a new indoor football practice facility, new
soccer fields, new facilities for baseball and softball and major renovations to Michigan
Stadium.
The Athletic Department is in excellent financial condition. Unlike most athletic departments,
our Athletic Department does not receive financial support from central campus. In fact, funds
are flowing back to central campus to support the academic mission of the University, thanks to
revenue generated by media and sponsorship contracts. We credit you and the leadership team
in the Athletics Department for these great successes.
On the academic front, you have integrated a new provost and vice president for research, and
have hired or retained a number of deans, academic leaders and key faculty in a range of
disciplines. When you started as president five years ago, lfe sciences were a high priority to
you and to the board and we are pleased with the high level of productivity of the Life Sciences
Institute. We anticipate important contributions in two new areas offocus in the years ahead.:
Energy research and environmental sustainability.  It is also worth noting that your
administration has given special attention to enhancing the undergraduate experience by
providing multiple undergraduate research opportunities and emphasizing interdisciplinary
instruction.
We know that none of these things could be accomplished without significant financial
resources, and your ability to bring in such resources is another area where you simply excel.
In May we celebrated reaching the Michigan Difference Campaign fundraising goal of $2.5
billion dollars- more than 18 months before the campaign officially ends! This is the largest
and most successful fund raising drive in the University's history. While there are still
underlying goals to meet before next December, we are confident that, under your leadership,
and with our outstanding development staff these additional goals will be met
The board would like to take special note and to publicly recognize your tireless and
extraordinary efforts to raise money for the University. We know that your personal attention to
donors and friends of the institution is a major reason for the Campaign's success. Just one of
countless examples where your efforts have paid off was your decision last fall to initiate two
new Campaign priorities using presidential matching funds, one for endowed chairs and the
other for need-based scholarships. Both initiatives exceeded everyone's expectations and
resulted in significant new resources coming into the University. Time and again, you have



ï~~September Meeting, 2007

convinced donors to give yet again, just as you have convinced many new donors to give for the
first time.
In addition to raising funds, you have worked closely with the provost in these challenging
economic times to align priorities and produce annual budgets that enhance academic
excellence across the institution, while assuring that a Michigan education is affordable. As to
this last point- affordability - it is worth noting that our financial aid packages are unmatched
by any university in Michigan.
And so we pause to congratulate you on another very successful year and a very successful first
term as president Whether we are standing with you on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court or
reading about ground breaking research by our faculty or hearing a monthly fundraising report
that breaks yet another record we recognize that your leadership has been extraordinary. We
look forward to your second term and we look forward to your continued successes as the
leader of this great institution.
Sincerely,
Julia Donovan Darlow                                       Laurence B. Deitch
Olivia P. Maynard                                         Rebecca McGowan
Andrea Fischer Newman                                      Andrew Richner
S. Martin Taylor                                          Katherine E. White
A standing ovation followed.
President Coleman responded that the board had honored her twice, first by
offering her the job five years ago, and again by offering her a contract extension last
year. She said, "this job had been every bit as challenging as I thought it would be, in a
very positive way. I am truly privileged to work with a board that cares so deeply
about the University. Even though we don't always agree with each other, you care
deeply, and I understand that." She also noted that "none of what I do would be
possible without this extraordinary team of vice presidents and chancellors." Finally,
she praised her office staff for '"the calm and the poise that they show in often difficult
circumstances." She noted that she and her husband, Ken, are "deeply embedded in
this community and we look forward to the next five years."
President's Salary
Regent Taylor moved that President Coleman be granted an increase of 3% in
her base salary for 2007-2008, for a new salary of $531,996.26. He noted that the
board took into consideration the fiscal situation of the state and the University, and the
salary increases being given to faculty, staff, deans, and executive officers, and
expressed regret that the increase could not have been higher. He pointed out that it is
due to the leadership of President Coleman that the University is thriving despite the
current difficult state fiscal situation.
Regent Richner seconded the motion. President Coleman stated that she and her
husband had decided that were she to be granted a salary increase, they would donate
the amount of the increase, minus any required taxes, to her new President's Donor
Challenge for graduate student support. Regent Taylor commented on the president's
generosity in donating her salary increase back to the University. He called for the
vote, and the motion to approve the president's salary increase was approved
unanimously.



ï~~September Meeting, 2007

Annual Report on Voluntary Support
Vice President May gave a presentation on voluntary support for 2006-2007.
The University had received $300 million in cash, the most ever received, representing
a 16.7% increase over the previous year. Total receipts in the Michigan Difference
campaign as of June 30, 2007, were $2.6 billion. He reported that 14,000 faculty and
staff have given more than $115 million to the campaign.
Vice President May displayed charts illustrating the progress toward goal in
various categories of the campaign.  He noted that of the 3,175 undergraduate
scholarships and graduate fellowships now available at the University, 1,000 of these
have been funded over the past 7 years as part of the Michigan Difference campaign.
The campaign has also resulted in the establishment of 20 new faculty chairs. Of the
current total of 437 endowed professorships, 169 have been added during this
campaign. He announced that a new, $20 million, President's Challenge has been
issued that will eventually leverage $60 million for graduate fellowships and
professional student support.
Regarding the endowment, he said that the campaign is on target to achieve the
$800 million goal. He noted that 14 facilities have reached their campaign goals, and
most of these have been completed and occupied. Vice President May described the
impact that the scholarship support received through the Michigan Difference campaign
has had on individual students, and that support for facilities has had on faculty,
students, and the Health System, highlighting especially the Stamps Scholars Program,
Joan and Sanford Weill Hall, the Graham Environmental Sustainability Institute and the
Graham Graduate Fellows, and the Rachel Upjohn Building, which houses the
Depression Center.
Vice President May commented about the invaluable contributions of Associate
Vice President Chacona Johnson, Senior Associate Vice President Robert Groves, and
Associate Vice President Jefferson Porter and other development staff, as well as the
president, Regents, executive officers, deans, directors, and volunteers.

housed in the Medical School, it is interdisciplinary and involves a number of schools
and colleges.

of Student Affairs.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little called attention to a 13%

Elizabeth A. Allen, Ph.D., associate professor of nursing in the School of
Nursing, retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2007.
Professor Allen received her B.S.N. and M.S. degrees from The Ohio State
University in 1965 and 1966, respectively, and her Ph.D. degree from the University of
South Carolina in 1973. Prior to joining the faculty at the University of Michigan, she
was an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina and served as coordinator
of continuing education for the American Nurses Association. Professor Allen joined
the University of Michigan faculty in 1976 as associate professor of nursing and
director of the continuing education program in the School of Nursing. She continued
as director until 1982, and served as interim director of the Center for Continuing
Education from 1982-83.
Early in her career, Professor Allen was a captain in the United States Army
Nurse Corps, serving as head nurse in a surgical intensive care unit during the Vietnam
War. Upon her return, and until 1988, she was a major in the Active Army Nurse



ï~~September Meeting, 2007

Corps Reserve. In 1987, Professor Allen was appointed by Governor James Blanchard
to the Agent Orange Commission, for which she was twice elected as chair. She spoke
frequently about veterans and veterans' issues, including post-traumatic stress
syndrome and its effect on the families of black veterans. Most recently, she organized
informative conferences on the war in Iraq to demonstrate how this military
engagement could affect nursing and the population of the State of Michigan.
Professor Allen was dedicated to her students, known for her high standards and
the desire to create future nurse leaders who are aware of and sensitive to issues of race,
poverty, and social justice. Her efforts to integrate an awareness of these issues into the
nursing curriculum will have a lasting impact on students and faculty.
The Regents now salute this distinguished nursing educator for her dedicated
service by naming Elizabeth A. Allen associate professor emerita of nursing.
John C. Dann, Ph.D., director of the William L. Clements Library of American
History and adjunct professor of history, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
retired on June 30, 2007.
Professor Dann received his B.A. degree from Dickinson College in 1962, and his
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the College of William and Mary in 1970 and 1975,
respectively. He joined the William L. Clements Library of American History as curator
of manuscripts in 1972 and was promoted to director of the library in 1977. He was
appointed lecturer in history in 1977 and named adjunct professor of history in 1993.
Professor Dann brought to his directorship an extraordinary knowledge of the
primary sources for American history and a unique understanding of the intricacies of
rare book collecting and the complexities of building a research collection. His research
focused on the colonial period of American history and social and humanitarian reform
movements of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He has edited and published a
number of historical texts, books, and journals which remain indispensable works in their
particular fields of scholarship, including the critically- acclaimed volumes, The
Revolution Remembered (1980) and The Nagle Journal (1988).
As director of the Clements Library, Professor Dann built with stunning success
on the library's strength in many of the traditional fields of American history. But during
his 30-year tenure as director, he also took the Clements collections in entirely new
directions. His great achievement has been to identify the foundation block of future
research interests, to recognize the research potential in material others had ignored, and
to use every resource available to acquire these materials for the Clements Library. Fully
one-third of the library's holdings are due to his acquisitions. Through his scholarship,
vision, and creative collecting, he transformed what was originally one man's personal
collection of Americana when it was founded in 1923, into an internationally renowned
research institution for the study of American history.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty administrator by naming John
C. Dann director emeritus of the William L. Clements Library of American History.
Barry G. England, Ph.D., associate professor of reproductive endocrinology,
Department of Pathology, and research associate professor in the Reproductive
Sciences Program, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical School, retired
from active faculty status on June 30, 2007.



ï~~September Meeting, 2007

Professor England received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Utah State
University in 1965 and 1967, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of
Wisconsin in 1971. He came to the University of Michigan in 1971 to pursue a
postdoctoral fellowship and complete training in the reproductive endocrinology
program in the Department of Pathology. He joined the University of Michigan faculty
in 1973 as an instructor in pathology and director of the Clinical Ligand Assay
Laboratory. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1974 and associate professor in
1982. He was appointed associate research scientist (now research associate professor)
in the Reproductive Sciences Program in 1995.
In 1997, Professor England was appointed associate director of the Central
Ligand Assay Satellite Services (CLASS) Laboratory of the NIH "Study of Women's
Health Across the Nation." He served as a consultant to the chemistry core facility of
the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center, and, together with Drs. M.B.
Khazaeli and W.H. Beierwaltes, holds the U.S. patent, "Monoclonal Antibodies Specific
for the Unbound B-Subunit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin." Professor England is a
member of a number of professional societies and served as president and vice-president
of the Midwest Radioassay Society. He has been an invited participant, scientist, or
lecturer at a number of international conferences and workshops and has published over
100 peer-reviewed journal articles, nearly 160 abstracts, and 5 book chapters.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Barry G.
England associate professor emeritus of reproductive endocrinology and research
associate professor emeritus.
David Hay Garabrant, M.D., M.P.H., professor of occupational medicine and
professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health, and associate professor of
emergency medicine, Medical School, retired from active faculty status on July 31,
2007.
Dr. Garabrant received his B.S. (1972) and M.D. (1976) degrees from Tufts
University and his M.P.H. (1979) and M.S. (1980) degrees from the Harvard School of
Public Health. He trained in internal medicine at Georgetown University Medical
Center and Boston University Medical Center from 1976-78 and in occupational
medicine at the Harvard School of Public Health from 1978-81. From 1981-88 he was
a faculty member at the University of Southern California. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty in 1988 as an associate professor of occupational medicine in the
School of Public Health. In 1989 he was also appointed associate professor of internal
medicine (later changed to emergency medicine) in the Medical School. He was
promoted to professor of occupational medicine in 1996 and in 2003 he received an
additional appointment as professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health.
Through his efforts in research, teaching, and clinical care, Dr. Garabrant
contributed to major advances in the areas of occupational health and occupational and
environmental cancer epidemiology. His seminal work in cancer epidemiology led to
the recognition of exercise as a protective factor in the prevention of colon cancer,
spurring broader efforts to understand the effects of physical activity on cancer risk.
His landmark work on dioxins in the environment led to a better understanding of risks
related to environmental contamination and exposure pathways by which human uptake
of dioxins leads to accumulation in the body. Dr. Garabrant was the first director of the
Center for Risk Science and Communication, which aimed to further the understanding



ï~~September Meeting, 2007

of human health risks related to chemicals and to effectively communicate these risks to
the public. He also held a number of other leadership positions in the School of Public
Health. He was awarded the School's Excellence in Research Award in 2006.
The Regents salute this distinguished faculty member by naming David Hay
Garabrant professor emeritus of occupational medicine, professor emeritus of
epidemiology, and associate professor emeritus of emergency medicine.
Duane M. Kirking, Ph.D., professor of social and administrative sciences in
the College of Pharmacy, and research scientist in the School of Public Health, retired
from active faculty status on August 31, 2007.
Professor Kirking received his B.S. degree from the University of Wisconsin in
1974, his Pharm.D. degree from the University of Kentucky in 1977, and his M.A. and
Ph.D. degrees from The Ohio State University in 1979 and 1980, respectively. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1980 as assistant professor of pharmacy
administration in the College of Pharmacy and assistant professor of medical care
organization in the School of Public Health. He was promoted to associate professor in
both disciplines in 1987. In 1998 he was promoted to professor in the College of
Pharmacy and became a research scientist in the School of Public Health.
In 2000, Professor Kirking became the first chair of the newly-created
Department of Social and Administrative Sciences in the College of Pharmacy. Upon
completion of his term in 2005, he was named director of the college's Center for
Medication Use, Policy, and Economics. In these roles, Professor Kirking helped the
college to maintain its status as one of the nation's top pharmacy schools and provided
critical leadership in the development of the first graduate program in social and
administrative sciences. He was a pioneer in the use of non-traditional, innovative
teaching methods designed to increase student involvement in the learning process.
Professor Kirking is a noted scholar and national leader in the assessment and
evaluation of the optimal use of medications in the treatment of disease. He has
received many awards for his work, including the prestigious Research Achievement
Award in the Pharmaceutical Sciences from the American Pharmacists Association
(APhA). He is also a leader in pharmacy practice, and has served on the board of
trustees of both the APhA and the United States Pharmacopeia.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated service
by naming Duane M. Kirking professor emeritus of social and administrative sciences
and research scientist emeritus.
R. Dale Lefever, Ph.D., assistant professor of family medicine, Medical School,
retired from active faculty status on June 30, 2007.
Professor Lefever received his B.A. degree from Wheaton College in 1965, and
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Michigan State University in 1967 and 1972,
respectively. From 1972-75, he was the assistant director of the Office of Medical
Education, Research, and Development at Michigan State University, and from 1975-78,
he was associate director of faculty development for the Association of American
Medical Colleges in Washington, D.C. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in
1978 as assistant professor of family medicine.
As one of the founding faculty members in the newly-created Department of
Family Medicine, Professor Lefever's major responsibility was as director of



ï~~September Meeting, 2007

educational development. His responsibilities were later expanded when he was
appointed assistant chair for planning and program development in 1995. In this role,
Professor Lefever filled a wide range of critical strategic planning, program
development, business development, and faculty mentor roles, including most
importantly, the role of counselor to both the founding and current department chairs.
Professor Lefever has served the Department of Family Medicine and the
University in a loyal, vigorous, and productive fashion during his entire career. The
extraordinary success of the Department of Family Medicine, recognized as an academic
and clinical leader both regionally and nationally, can be attributed to a considerable
degree to Professor Lefever's wisdom, leadership, and loyalty. Few would argue that any
faculty member has made more important contributions to the success of the Department
of Family Medicine than Professor Lefever.   His wisdom, guidance, leadership
experience, and educational expertise were critical to the department's growth, to its
having successfully weathered many troubles and crises, and to its subsequent flourishing
as a leading, highly-ranked, academic department.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member and scholar for his
dedicated service by naming R. Dale Lefever assistant professor emeritus of family
medicine.

(2007)
The University of Michigan is committed to a policy of nondiscrimination and equal

status. The University also is committed to compliance with all applicable laws regarding

Regent Taylor read the following letter from Regent Deitch:
September 15, 2007
Dear Martin:
As we discussed earlier this week I have unexpectedly been called away to Asia on business.
That being the case, I am unable to participate in the Regents' meeting of September 20, 2007.
I am disappointed by that fact because I was very much looking forward to voting in the
affirmative on the proposed change to Regents' Bylaw 1406
I am now completing my 15th year as a Regent of the University of Michigan. In 1993, which
was my first year on the Board I co-sponsored the last amendment to Regents' Bylaw 14.06
with Regent McGowan. That amendment added sexual orientation to the Bylaw. From the
standpoint of personally having had a positive impact on the culture of our university
community, it is my proudest achievement as a Regent I am confident that Regent McGowan
shares that view.
Now, 15 years later, President Coleman has suggested adding "gender identity" and "gender
expression" to the Bylaw. I commend her for her thoughful and progressive leadership on this
issue and I wanted everyone to know that I enthusiastically and wholeheartedly endorse this
amendment and wouldbe voting in the affirmative were I able to be present
I firmly believe that discrimination of any kind is both repugnant and reprehensible. Therefore,
I am pleased that we are taking this step to address the deeply felt concerns of members of our



ï~~September Meeting, 2007

community. As in 1993, this very simple change will have a profoundly positive impact on the
culture of our community. I am delighted about that fact
I ask that you read this letter at the meeting and have it entered into the minutes of proceedings.
Best regards to all.
Sincerely,
Laurence B. Deitch
Regent McGowan, addressing the audience members who had come to the
meeting in support of this measure, said, "I just want to thank you on my own behalf
for coming in the first instance, and for coming back, and for coming back, and for
coming back."
Regent Maynard said, "It's been a long time, and it really feels good to finally
be able to vote in the affirmative."
The vote was then taken, and the motion was approved, with Regents Darlow,
Maynard, McGowan, Taylor, and White voting in favor, and Regents Newman and
Richner opposed.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Bill Higgins, citizen, on addiction and
relationships at the U of M; Richard Bollinger, alumnus, on lack of Michigan content
on Michigan Radio; and Jim Mogenson, citizen, on industrial funding of research at the
University.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 5:00 p.m. The
next meeting is scheduled for October 25, 2007.

Greg Tewksbury. The final discussion was the regular bi-monthly internal audit
update, with Carol Senneff, executive director of University Audits. Ms. Senneff met
privately with Regent McGowan following her report.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of this committee, reported that fellow committee members Regents Darlow and
Newman had joined him in the meeting. The committee received a regular update on
dean and major director reviews and searches, and received and discussed a report from
Chancellor Kay on Flint Campus faculty and staff recruitment and retention. The third
agenda item involved a discussion with Vice President Churchill regarding a review of
the Regents' Bylaws that have obsolete and anachronistic provisions. The final agenda
item concerned laws applicable to governing boards. The latter two items would be
addressed in more detail at future meetings.

numerous and highly-significant contributions during his career.
Thomas D. Gelehrter, M.D., professor of human genetics and professor of
internal medicine, Medical School, retired from active faculty status on September 30,
2007.
Dr. Gelehrter received his B.A. degree from Oberlin College in 1957. A
Rhodes Scholar, he received his M.A. degree from the University of Oxford in 1959
and his M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School in 1963. After completing his
residency at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1965, he was a researcher at the
National Institutes of Health from 1965-69, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of
Washington from 1969-70, and a faculty member at Yale University School of
Medicine from 1970-74. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1974 as
associate professor of human genetics and associate professor of internal medicine, and
was promoted to professor of human genetics and professor of internal medicine in
1976.
Dr. Gelehrter is an internationally recognized expert in human genetics.
Following his early research, which helped improve the understanding of the regulation
of enzyme activity in mammalian cells, his work has centered on understanding the
plasminogen activation system and the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation
of the PAl-1 and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) genes. He was director of medical
genetics in the Department of Internal Medicine from 1977-87 and chair of the
Department of Human Genetics from 1987-2004. Dr. Gelehrter has been a leader in
developing and refining the Medical School's genetics curriculum and has been director
of the core human genetics course for many years. He is the author of a leading textbook,
Principles of Medical Genetics, which is used at medical schools around the world. An
outstanding mentor and clinician, he is noted for his sensitivity and compassion in
dealing with patients.
Among Dr. Gelehrter's honors is the University's Distinguished Faculty
Achievement Award (1997). He is an elected member of the American Society of
Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians, serves on the board
of directors of the American Society of Human Genetics, and is a founding fellow of

necessary to preserve, display, and disseminate their cultural treasures. She established the
framework for the school's practical engagement program, and chaired the faculty

ï~~NOVEMBER MEETING, 2007

The University ofMiehigan
Ann Arbor
November 15, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Founder's Room, Alumni Center,
Ann Arbor campus. Present were President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch,
Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and Taylor. Also present were Vice President
and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Interim
Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice President Kelch, Interim Vice President Hage, Vice

Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent White arrived at 4:10
p.m.
Call to Order
The meeting began with an address to the University community by President
Coleman.
President's Address to the University Conunmmunity
Five years ago, as I stood with the Regents to accept the position of president of the University
ofMichigan, I could not have imagined the journey that awaited me or the University.
We have seen our campus grow and prosper, with new academic programs at all levels of study,
stunning new teaching and research facilities, and most importantly, a stronger community
committed to discovering new knowledge and applying it toward the betterment of society.
This fall with the support and counsel of the Regents, I am beginning a second five-year term,
and I am tremendously excited about the opportunities that lie before us as a public university
in this rapidly changing world
After all, universities exist to pave the way to tomorrow. We seek cures for diseases; we work to
understand the dynamics of emerging economies; we study ways to protect our natural
environment; and above all, we educate young people seeking to better themselves through
knowledge and new perspectives.
The University of Michigan must continually change to meet- and to anticipate - the needs of
an evolving society. To do so, we must be prepared to rethink what we do and how we do it,
and to explore new paths that will lead us in entirely new directions.
One of our key strengths as a teaching and research institution - and one that positions us well
for the challenges ahead - is our unique breadth and scale. With 19 schools and colleges, a
thriving health system, and three campuses, the University of Michigan has an unparalleled
richness of intellectual diversity that can be brought to bear on the challenges we face as a
university and a society.
And with a community of students, faculty, and staff drawn from throughout Michigan, across
the nation, and around the globe, we have a wealth of perspectives that critically inform our
understanding of our complex world
All of us know the feeling of standing in Michigan Stadium and watching the Michigan
Marching Band high-step onto the field It is a remarkable display, and no matter how many
games we attend it's still something we soak up as part of the Michigan experience.
Most members of our marching band are not music students. They approach life as aspiring
engineers, historians, scientists and teachers. They are students of different backgrounds and
talents who come together to create something special.



ï~~November Meeting, 2007

They are also our most visible symbol of interdisciplinary work at Michigan.
No other university offers faculty and students our scope and scale of fields of study, and the
opportunities to push their ideas in new directions. We have seen this for decades, beginning
with the Institute for Social Research, the gold standard for academic collaboration.
The potential combinations are endless.
Consider Janet Smith and David Sherman. Dr. Smith is a structural biologist, specifically a
crystallographer. Dr. Sherman is a professor of medicinal chemistry, with his roots in
pharmacy.
Crystallographers and pharmacists generally work in separate worlds. But Professors Smith
and Sherman have collaborated to attack the growing problem of drug-resistant infections
brought on by superbugs. In fact they are outsmarting these superbugs thatput us all at risk
This is groundbreaking work. I know, as a scientist and a university president this achievement
occurred only because of the interdisciplinary setting of the Life Sciences Institute and the
interdisciplinary culture of Michigan.
This kind of work has never been more important  Great universities like Michigan must
transcend disciplines to be truly effective in addressing societal needs.
Working with Provost Sullivan, I want to exploit this core strength by launching an innovative
hiring program forfaculty specifically committed to interdisciplinary collaboration.
Over the next five years, we will fund 100 tenure-track faculty positions, to expand
interdisciplinary work and to increase faculty connections with undergraduates.
These 100 junior faculty positions will be centrally funded meaning they will complement the
regular faculty hiring in the schools and colleges, and will be awarded through competitive
proposals to the provost
Priority will be given to faculty positions that support our major initiatives, such as energy and
environmental sustainability. I want to encourage cluster hiring, with groups offaculty focused
on emerging areas of scholarship and creativity.
New hires require resources, so in addition to committing $10 million for salaries and benefits,
we will designate $20 million for start-up costs.
This is a major commitment - financially and philosophically. And it requires a major
commitment from our deans and department chairs to be truly effective.
As faculty evaluate scholarship, they must challenge each other to think diferently about work
that crosses boundaries. We have several deans with us today, and I encourage them to
experiment with this new hiring program, to mentor and support these new hires, and to push
the University in entirely new directions.
Our new professors will be a strong addition to the undergraduate experience. The latest
National Survey of Student Engagement tells us U-M students find themselves far more engaged
than their peers elsewhere. They are accustomed to working in groups, collaborating with
students of different backgrounds, and organizing their ideas in new ways.
Michigan's academic excellence presents itself in a student experience that draws on a diversity
of ideas, beliefs, ethnicities and personal backgrounds. Ours is an environment that shapes our
students and is shaped by them.
Let's build upon that as we prepare students for life - and an interdisciplinary life at that
An essential component of a Michigan education is our approach to the arts. The arts are a
fundamental form of thinking that complements scientific approaches to the world and its
challenges.
To appreciate the arts at Michigan, think about all we have seen unfold in recent years,
especially on North Campus. We have the Walgreen Drama Center and the Arthur Miller
Theatre. The Bentley Historical Library with its invaluable holdings has doubled in size. The



ï~~November Meeting, 2007

Duderstadt Center is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for collaborations in multimedia.
The Stamps Auditorium will soon come online to serve the campus.
And the deans of our North Campus schools and colleges have come together as no deans
before them to lead the Arts on Earth initiative that explores the importance of the arts to
creativity and innovation.
I propose we use the gathering momentum ofArts on Earth to further energize North Campus as
an epicenter of creativity.
Is North Campus like Central Campus? No, and by design it never will be. It is its own
distinctive place, with distinguished academic programs and beautiful natural surroundings.
To enhance this, I want us to explore creating a residential community on North Campus to
nurture and strengthen creativity.
Throughout the University, we have living-learning communities that provide students a home
and culture thatfeeds their interests.
Let's find a way to develop a dynamic setting that provides a unique living experience for
students with a passion for the arts, possibly by transforming and renovating Baits Hall.
And let's complement that with a space on North Campus that serves as an inter-arts center- a
nexus for research, outreach and curricular programs that draws on the countless ways in
which the arts shape our thinking and our thinking shapes the arts. It might be a place where
dancers gather to practice, where engineers and musicians collaborate with psychologists, and
where architects and painters find studio space.
It should be a nexus for creativity, because creativity is essential to critical thinking and
innovation.
I also want more of our students to see more of the world  Whether you view the world as
getting flatter or smaller, the fact is we are more interconnected than ever.
As other nations emerge as economic powers and our society grows more international so, too,
must a student's education. There is so much to be learned from observing, from interacting,
and from listening to people who live and work in different cultures than ours.
That is why I traveled to China in 2005 to establish partnerships with China's best universities.
And it is why I will lead a University delegation to Ghana and South Africa next February.
Two years ago, a bipartisan congressional commission called for 1 million American students
to be studying abroad by 2017. The year 2017 has special significance on our campus because
it is our bicentennial and I want U-M to be a leader in reaching this study abroad goal.
Just this week as we hosted China's ambassador to the United States, we were named one of
the top American research universities for having students study overseas. At least 1,800 U-M
students take advantage of study abroad programs annually, and I want us to double that
number in the next five years. I am intentionally setting the bar high because I believe this is
critical to preparing tomorrow's students for a more culturally diverse and more cooperative
world
We must find ways to make the international study experience more flexible, creative and
affordable. Our future and the future of our nation depend on it
The importance of international study is a perfect segue to the University's role in society and
how we engage with the communities we serve.
This month marks a significant anniversary for our great state. Fifty years ago, the Mackinac
Bridge opened and Michigan was never the same. The Mighty Mac transformed commerce and
tourism in Michigan and literally brought us closer together as a state.
The University of Michigan is just as vital a bridge to the future for our state. Our impact must
be broad because the future of American competitiveness depends vitally on transforming the
Midwest.



ï~~November Meeting, 2007

That means being a university that helps shape a strong Michigan economy, provides the best
health care possible to citizens, offers exceptional regional campuses, and works with the K-12
system to increase the number of college-educated citizens - students who will be tomorrow's
decision-makers.
Our work begins with expanding our leadership role in restructuring a state economy that is
undergoing dramatic change.
For the past year, we have worked arm-in-arm with Michigan State University and Wayne State
University to capitalize upon our combined research assets for the state's benefit As the
University Research Corridor, our institutions bring in 95 percent of all the external R&D
dollars that come into the state. And together we conduct well over $1.3 billion in research
activity.
It is probable that within five years, U-M will cross the threshold of $1 billion annually in
research, and the contributions of MSU and Wayne State will only add to the firepower of the
URC.
And still U-M can do more.
For our state to prosper, we absolutely must cultivate a stronger culture of innovation and
entrepreneurship.
We should remember with pride that pioneers like Henry Forda Herbert H. Dow and W.K.
Kellogg shaped the 20th century and made our state a powerhouse of manufacturing and
technology. And we must remind ourselves and our community that U-M was founded to
improve the public welfare through engagement
Drawing on this heritage, we are prepared to embark on a partnership with society that is a
first for higher education.
Joining with Michigan's other public universities and leading foundations across the state, we
propose a collaboration to drive innovation and entrepreneurship for developing knowledgebased industries in Michigan.
The Michigan Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative, with at least $100 million available
in resources, will be funded by foundations and universities themselves. The Initiative will
advance commercialization of university research, promote partnerships between higher
education and industry, and propel the work of entrepreneurial students and faculty.
This will evolve into a massive public-private partnership. It is, in effect, an investment in the
people and ideas that emerge from our public universities as drivers of a knowledge-based
economy.
We have received $2 million in seed funding from the CS. Mott Foundation for our initial
planning. With supporters from the Council of Michigan Foundations and the foundation
community at the table with us, we look forward to launching the Initiative in the months ahead
There are many, many details to process, but this should not hinder us from finding ways to
jumpstart the Michigan economy.
Equally vital to our commitment to the state are U-M's regional campuses.
I consider myself extremely fortunate to lead a university with not one great campus, but three.
Chancellor Dan Little ofDearborn, and Interim Chancellor Jack Kay and his predecessor, Juan
Mestas, at Flint, have excelled at establishing their campuses as community anchors.
UM-Flint is a focal point for the growth of Genesee County, and its expansion as a residential
campus solidifies its role in Flint's rebirth.
UM-Dearborn is equally central to the vitality of southeast Michigan. As a valued partner in
metropolitan Detroit's growth, UM-Dearborn extends the University's impact on a region that
has been our home since 1817.



ï~~November Meeting, 2007

I anticipate our regional campuses growing significantly in enrollment in the coming years as
they devote themselves to educating our citizens for the new Michigan economy.
We cannot talk about an engaged University of Michigan without devoting serious attention to
our health care system and the exceptional work itperforms.
Most Michigan citizens typically interact with U-M not as students, but as football fans or as
patients- or relatives of patients Where some 880, 000 people will visit Michigan Stadium this
year, the Health System will see twice as many, and for far more critical reasons.
In fact just a single day in the life of our Health System means 10 babies will be born, more
than 4,300 people will walk into our clinics, some 170 patients will be in the hands of our
surgeons, and more than 200 people will be here for emergency care.
And we will be there for them. We will be there, and we will be more advanced and more
efficient than ever.
Our university is growing the health industry of Michigan. And to succeed as a health system,
we must expand in all directions: with our patient care, our research, and our training of
tomorrow's doctors, nurses, pharmacists and dentists.
To be a health care leader, we absolutely must have optimal facilities for patients and the
caregivers who treat them. Our plan calls for us to invest more than $3 billion in the
maintenance, renovation, and expansion of facilities and equipment over the next 10 years. We
will increase the size and capabilities of the core Medical Campus, as well as East Ann Arbor
and other ambulatory care sites.
As our Health System grows, we also must work harder and smarter to coordinate our activities
to control costs, while providing the best care for our patients.
I am urging our clinical schools of Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry and Pharmacy to find more
ways to coordinate their work to avoid duplication and maximize their resources. By planning
together, the health sciences at Michigan will become known as a distinct- and distinctive -
entity of this university.
That same expertise, including Public Health, also plays a leadership role in shaping national
health care discussions and solutions.
I am very proud of the contributions we make to reduce medical costs while also improving the
health of our own employees. In particular, our Michigan Healthy Community initiative works
to keep the well well and reach out to those at risk to improve their well-being.
Of course, in addition to providing first-rate health care, U-M provides a top-notch education
that is a gateway to personal and professional success for qualified applicants. But our
doorways will be empty if we do not engage more with the K-12 system, to expand the pipeline
ofstudents eager for a college education.
We opened the U-M Detroit Center a year ago to increase the community's access to our
admissions office and other programs. I want to see us establish a similar presence in western
Michigan, so students and their families can come face-to-face with representatives of the
University and better understand what we offer.
Many have looked to us for guidance on improving our public schools by drawing on our
strengths in education and social work  We recently inventoried our campus programs that
partner with the K-12 system, and it is an impressive catalog of outreach designed to help raise
students' performance and aspirations.
Yet like the University itself our outreach programs are highly decentralized
To give greater focus and impact to our K-12 programs, we will establish a Center for Outreach
and Engagement to coordinate and elevate what U-M contributes to our public schools. The
Center for Outreach was a recommendation of the Diversity Blueprints report that came out
following the passage ofProposal 2.



ï~~November Meeting, 2007

I want to send a very clear message that the University ofMichigan is here for the young people
of our communities, students who will be future leaders in our state and beyond
One of our state's greatest leaders and perhaps this university's most respected alumnus was
Gerald Ford and we are learning more about him in a new book of off-the-record
conversations. One passage shows President Ford in the months after leaving office, a period
when he could have elected to lead the secluded life of an ex-president
Instead he relished what he called "his new life."
I'm a pragmatist, "he said "I prefer thinking about the future. "
I love that philosophy, because it exemplifies the mission of President Ford's alma mater. We
are thinking, always, about the future, and that future must include a pragmatic approach to the
financial underpinnings of this great university.
Everyone knows that public financing of our universities is on a slow, steady decline. We will
continue to make the case that Michigan's system of higher education is among our state's
greatest assets, and more public investment is essential to our competitiveness as a state, and a
nation.
I have devoted my entire career to public universities.  Thirty-five years and six state
universities have shown me over and over again the impact of public universities on the greater
good of society.
The University ofMichigan will never stray from its public mission. It is our birthright, and one
we treasure. As long as we receive one dollar from the state, we will be a public university, and
an exceptional one at that
However, this decline of public support poses a severe challenge to our ability to meet our
obligations to the state. We are addressing this challenge through aggressive fundraising with
alumni and friends who believe in our value to future generations. I cannot say enough about
the support of the Michigan Difference campaign. We met our goal of $2.5 billion, and if we
sustain our momentum through to the 2008 deadline, we may well reach $3 billion in support of
financial aid for our students, professorships for our faculty, and programs that lead to new
knowledge.
And when our campaign is complete, we will continue to emphasize private support as
fundamental to the future of the University.
We also adjust to the fiscal realities of the day through exceptional stewardship of our
resources, building an endowment that assures our stability and growth for the long term.
A strong and growing endowment such as ours guarantees - in perpetuity - our ability to carry
out our mission and adapt to change.
In two days, the Michigan football team will face Ohio State in one of the most storied rivalries
in college athletics. Saturday also marks the one-year anniversary of the passing of Bo
Schembechler.
We all know Bo's mantra: The team, the team, the team! That comes through loud and clear in
a new book about his leadership principles. Bo advises that to lead you need goals. And those
goals must come from the people responsible for achieving them.
I have great aspirations for our university, goals I could not set without the strong counsel and
support of our Regents, executive officers and deans, and through them dedicated faculty and
staff We set high standards for ourselves atMichigan, because we strive to be the best
Ours is a university unlike any other. The University of Michigan has helped cure polio, sent
men to the moon, and deepened our understanding of human existence through the humanities
and social sciences. Today, we are working to digitize and share the wonders of our massive
library. We are pursuing the promise of stem cells and biotechnologies. And we are committed
to the principle that a great public university embraces a diversity of people and ideas.



ï~~November Meeting, 2007

As we prepare for tomorrow, the University of Michigan will change, adapt and grow to meet
the needs of society. We will always keep an eye on the horizon, because we are in this forever.
It has been a privilege to serve this university for the last five years, and I am grateful for the
support of the regents and so many others. I look forward to joining with all of you as we work
together to carry this great university to even greater heights.
Thankyou.
A standing ovation followed. Regent Maynard thanked President Coleman for
her service during the last five years, and said that she looks forward to the challenge
ahead. "There are going to be some exciting challenges, including some you didn't
even mention which we will face together." She also thanked President Coleman for
recognizing the value that the regional campuses add to the University's quality and for
recognizing the value of diversity in our University community.

ï~~November Meeting, 2007

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted one faculty
retirement memoir.
Amiya K. Hajra, Ph.D., professor of biological chemistry and research
professor, Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute, Medical School, retired
from active faculty status on August 31, 2007.
A native of Bengal, India, Professor Hajra received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees
from the University of Calcutta in 1953 and 1956, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree
from Northwestern University in 1963. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in
1960 as a research assistant in the Mental Health Research Institute (now the Molecular
and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute), where he was mentored by eminent
biochemists Drs. Norman Radin and Bernard Agranoff. He was promoted to assistant
research biochemist in 1963, associate research scientist in 1968, research scientist in
1982, senior research scientist in 1997, and research professor in 2003. Within the
Department of Biological Chemistry, Professor Hajra was appointed assistant professor
in 1969, and was promoted to associate professor in 1974 and professor in 1981.
As a member of a research institute dedicated to the brain sciences, Professor
Hajra's scholarly contributions reflect significantly on the mission of the Molecular and
Behavioral Neuroscience Institute. Through his extensive biochemical and chemical
knowledge and imaginative approach to science, he has contributed substantively to our
knowledge of the function of brain lipids. He has amassed an extensive bibliography of
scientific publications in prestigious, peer-reviewed journals.  Throughout his
distinguished career, Professor Hajra has been the recipient of numerous honors,
including the coveted Javits Award of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases
and Stroke in 1988. His expertise has been further recognized by his service on NIH
study sections and on the editorial boards of prestigious biochemical journals.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Amiya K. Hajra
professor emeritus of biological chemistry and research professor emeritus.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the Regents
this month.
Degrees. There were no actions with respect to degrees this month.
Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded
by Regent Taylor, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda. The
Regents then turned to consideration of the regular agenda.
Report of University Internal Audits, July 2007 - September 2007
Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the report of the Office of
University Audits activities for the period July 2, 2007 through September 30, 2007.
Alternative Asset Commitments
Executive Vice President Slottow informed the Regents about follow-on
commitments that have been      made with the following     previously-approved
partnerships: $15 million to Ceyuan Ventures II, L.P.; $22 million to ChrysCapital V,
L.P.; and $60 million to Ashmore Global Special Situations Fund 4, L.P.



ï~~November Meeting, 2007

Request for Nomination of Trustee for the William W. Cook Trust
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved the appointment of Michael J. Levitt as co-trustee of the
William W. Cook Trust.
Art and Architecture Building Addition
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Robert Hull, principal of the
architectural firm The MillerIHull Partnership, LLP. Mr. Hull commented that this
addition, for the A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, is
meant to address three issues: extending the existing, strong, programmatic approach
to architecture and urban planning; sending a strong environmental and sustainability
message; and providing a new architectural face for the building. He displayed a
photograph of the existing building and drawings and schematics illustrating the
various features of the addition, which is to be placed on top of the existing building.
He noted that the addition will be oriented so as to make maximum use of solar energy,
and displayed a rendering of the exterior.
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the schematic design for the Art and Architecture Building
Addition Project, as presented at the meeting.
Madelon Louisa Stockwell Hall Renovation
Executive Vice President Slottow introduced Jean Carroon, principal with
Goody Clancy, to present the schematic design for the Madelon Louisa Stockwell Hall
Renovation. Ms. Carroon gave a presentation describing the project, noting that 90%
of the budget is allocated toward addressing infrastructure repairs, maintenance, and
upgrades. Because the existing kitchen and dining areas on the lower levels are being
vacated due to construction of the new dining center, this space will be available to
address programmatic needs. She displayed a model of how this two-story space will
be transformed by creation of a new, covered, central courtyard space that will be
available to all Hill residents and that is expected to become the heart of the building.
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Deitch, the Regents
unanimously approved the schematic design for the Madelon Louisa Stockwell Hall
Renovation Project as presented at the meeting.

employees, are members of the board of directors of Michigan Information
Technology Center.
Master Agreement between the University of Michigan and Universal Display
Corporation
The Regents approved a master agreement with Universal Display Corporation
(UDC) that would enable UDC to fund research projects at the University from time to

Master Agreement between the University of Michigan and Michigan Critical
Care Consultants, Inc.
The Regents approved a master agreement with Michigan Critical Care
Consultants, Inc. ("Company") which will allow the Company to have the University
participate in various projects which it will support independently or from grants from
federal agencies. Because Robert Bartlett, a University of Michigan employee, is also
part-owner    and  scientific  advisory   board   member     of  Michigan    Critical Care
Consultants, Inc., this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.    The following    information   is provided    in  compliance with     statutory
requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Michigan Critical Care
Consultants, Inc.
2. The University will enter into a master agreement with the Company that will cover
standard procedures for performance of projects as well as provisions implementing
University and federal policies related to intellectual property and publication. The
master agreement will cover an initial five-year period with a total authorization not
to exceed $500,000. The University will use standard sponsored project accounting
procedures to determine the cost of each project. Budgets will be reviewed and
approved by authorized representatives of each department and school/college
where projects are to be performed.
The Company has supported sixteen projects at the University since its inception.
The master agreement will allow the University and the Company to specify
projects that the University will conduct under the terms of the master agreement.
Since research projects are often amended, the master agreement includes provisions
for changes in time, amount, and scope of each supported project. University
procedures for approval of each project will be followed and additional review by
the Medical School Conflict of Interest Board will be done on a project-by-project
basis.

$5,300 for Unit Type A and $4,200 for Unit Type B, as described in the Regents
Communication.
University of Michigan Press Distribution Agreement with Pluto Press
Regent Deitch observed that typically during the public comments session,
Regents do not respond to comments. However, today, he, along with Regent Newman
and Regent Richner, "feel compelled to offer our views on a topic that we think is of
immense importance, and we felt in a free speech environment our views ought to be
heard."
Regent Deitch said the topic they would be commenting on is the decision of
the faculty executive board of the University of Michigan Press to not terminate the
Press's contract with Pluto Press. He stated that "we have only the deepest respect for
the committee and for the faculty and for its decision-making process, and we would
assume that the ultimate decision on the relationship would be made consistent with
that process." He said that the three Regents decided the most efficient way for them to
make their views known to the committee would be to provide a letter to the committee
which would be read today and offered into the record.
Regent Deitch emphasized that "at the University of Michigan we welcome full
debate on all controversial topics, and the letter that will be read reflects words inserted
by Regent Newman, Regent Richner, and myself."
Regent Newman then read the following letter, addressed to the University of
Michigan Press Faculty Executive Board:
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We are writing to express our grave disappointment over the decision of the Faculty Executive
Board of the University ofMichigan Press (the "Press") to continue the Distribution Agreement
with Pluto Press. We urge reconsideration of that decision prior to the upcoming November 30
deadline for a termination effective June 30, 2008. We believe the Press should exit all of its
distribution arrangements with publishers unaffiliated with the University on an orderly basis
for reasons explained below. Alternatively, we provide you our thoughts on policy guidelines
for distribution agreements between the Press and various publishers as we understand that it is
the Faculty Executive Board's present intent to adopt such guidelines.
We note that "The Regents of the University of Michigan" are the contracting party on all
University contracts. Therefore, the Board has the power to terminate such contracts. We have
elected not to do so out of respectfor your committee. Nevertheless, we feel so strongly about
this decision and its negative ramifications for the University that we felt obligated to write lest
the public conclude that our silence reflects agreement with the decision.
We believe that the Press ought to exit all of its distribution arrangements with unaffiliated
publishers because of the Press' complete lack of authority over the content of distributed books
while the University retains complete responsibility for negative public reaction to such books.
The University and Pluto Press are linked whether or not the words "University of Michigan"
are on the books. The books are on the University Press' distribution list which sets forth that



ï~~November Meeting, 2007

Pluto Press is located in "London and Ann Arbor" and the public record contains the
enthusiastic endorsement of Pluto Press books generally by the University Press' Director,
Philip Pochoda.
We note that many members of the University community are deeply offended by the recently
published book "Overcoming Zionism: Creating a Single Democratic State in Israel/Palestine"
by Joel Kovel which has been perceived as anti-Semitic and poorly researched Indeed Mr.
Pochoda himself has stated that the book raised issues of hate speech, calling it a reckless,
vicious, and unmodulated attack on Zionism and all Zionists." We acknowledge that some may
have found the book thought provoking and/or agreed with its thesis. To us, the merits of the
book are irrelevant to our central concern.
We simply assert that the money which the Press receives from distributing Pluto Press books is
outweighed by the reputational damage to the University from publishing books over which
University faculty or staff has no editorial control. In our judgment, that is what has happened
here and we believe this result must be avoided in the future. At a recent meeting, Mr. Pochoda
informed the Board of Regents that based on an informal survey that he did 75% of all
University presses do not distribute the books of others for a fee. In our judgment, the
University Press should join that super majority of University presses immediately.
To scale the economics of the situation, in fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007 the net Pluto Press
revenue was 4% to 5% of the Press' total net revenue. We simply do not believe that this small
amount of revenue warrants the potential for profound reputational damage and concomitant
disaffection and lack of support for the University among people who find books like Mr.
Kovel's to be poorly reasoned biased and deeply offensive. In asking for termination of all
distribution agreements with unaffiliated publishers, we affirm our staunch support for the
Press. A great university like ours should have a press to publish books that would not find a
home among commercial trade publishers.
Further, we wish to make it clear that, in our considered judgment, this is not a freedom of
speech or academic freedom issue. We affirm our commitment to those principles. We are not
suggesting Kovel's book be "banned " We believe that our faculty, students and staff should
feel free to express whatever views they have without fear of censorship. However, we do not
believe freedom of speech principles should be used as a guise to require the University to use
its resources to sell and distribute commercially every book deal that comes its way. In a news
release, the Press, with your approval stated that the Board "would not have recommended
publication" of Kovel's manuscript had it "gone through the standard review process used by
the University ofMichigan Press." Sound judgment should lead thoughful people to conclude
that the Press should not disseminate books unworthy of its own imprint To do otherwise, only
debases the Press 'franchise and leaves the Press and the University open to damage. This is a
commercial and policy issue, not a free speech issue. We firmly believe that the University of
Michigan should not make money from books that do not meet our own scholarship standards.
Should your Board elect not to end all of its distribution agreements, we urge that you adopt a
policy requiring that the Press only enter into distribution agreements with publishers whose
standards of review for publication are no less rigorous than that of the Press itself Moreover,
we insist that the Press itself or an appropriate scholarly peer review panel, review works of
potential authors prior to being accepted for publication to ensure the academic quality,
integrity, and contribution of an individual's work
Thank you for considering these views. We will continue to monitor this situation through the
office of the Provost

ï~~DECEMBER MEETING, 2007

The University ofMichigan
Ann Arbor
December 13, 2007
The Regents convened at 3:00 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, and Taylor. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Interim Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Interim Vice President Hage, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little,
Vice President May, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice
President Wilbanks. Regent White was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order and called attention to the
upcoming winter commencement, the proposed building projects on the agenda, and the
environmental report being presented at the meeting.
Dean's Report: Division of Kinesiology
President Coleman introduced Dean Beverly Ulrich, who gave an update on the
Division of Kinesiology. She noted that kinesiology is one of nine undergraduate
schools and is the fourth largest in terms of undergraduate enrollment, with 800
students. She described the four undergraduate majors--physical education, sport
management, athletic training, and movement science--and highlighted the "Go Global"
program which provides study abroad opportunities for kinesiology students. She
noted that graduate enrollment has been steadily increasing, with emphasis on the Ph.D.
program.
Dean Ulrich discussed the division's research program and described some of
the research projects underway. She noted that there has been a rapid increase in
external funding over the past decade. Funds raised through the Michigan Difference
campaign have resulted in the division's first endowed professorship and establishment
of the Michigan Sport Injury Prevention Center.
Dean Ulrich concluded by noting how pleased the division is with the new
space provided by the renovation of Observatory Lodge, and she thanked the Regents
for their ongoing support.
Update on Environmental Initiatives
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that Associate Vice President Baier
would be presenting highlights of the second annual report on the University's
environmental programs.
Associate Vice President Baier reviewed progress that had been made on the six
point Environmental and Energy Initiatives Plan since it was first announced in April
2007 and noted that this report fulfills the first of the six points, which calls for an
annual report. Discussions with DTE Energy are ongoing regarding the second point,
renewable energy. With respect to the third point, alternative transportation, he said



ï~~December Meeting, 2007

that ridership on University busses and on AATA busses ("M-Ride") continues to
increase. In the area of purchasing, "green" alternatives are being highlighted on the
University's website. On the fifth point, new construction and renovation projects, he
pointed out that the University's energy performance standards have always been
higher than the average, and are now exceeding those standards and pushing for even
better energy performance. The final initiative, development of "Wolverine Teams," is
proceeding in a pilot phase.
The environmental report tracks six main indicators on the Ann Arbor campus
over a four-year period: total energy use, which he described as fairly flat; energy use
normalized to population and building square footage (shows a downward trend); air
emissions, which, he pointed out, is almost all produced by stationary sources and
shows a downward trend for carbon dioxide; water use (remains flat); and land use
(best management practices are being implemented, for example, the North Campus
wetland basin storm water detention system). Another indicator, van pool usage, has
steadily increased to the current 479 riders who participate in 76 van pools, which have
traveled a combined 9 million passenger miles in one year and eliminated the need for
400 parking spaces. Mr. Baier said that centralized chiller plants, which have replaced
some individual building chillers, have provided savings in energy, water, operating
and maintenance costs, and capital costs. In addition, recycling efforts have been
ongoing across campus for many years, resulting in an overall campus solid-waste
recycling rate of approximately 30%.
Mr. Baier thanked the leadership of the Graham Environmental Sustainability
Institute and the Department of Occupational Safety and Environmental Health for their
assistance in preparing this report. He noted that seven schools and colleges, along
with nine centers and institutes, have programs relating directly to sustainability issues,
and acknowledged the Housing Division and the University of Michigan Health System
for their particularly noteworthy environmental stewardship programs.
Mr. Baier concluded that the annual environmental report will provide a means
for focusing, analyzing, and improving the University's wide-ranging environmental
stewardship efforts. It will be publicly available on a website through the Department
of Occupational Safety and Environmental Health.
Regent Maynard inquired about the University's use of renewable energy
sources, such as solar and wind power. Mr. Baier responded that some photovoltaic
cells are in use, but only as demonstration models, and solar heat collectors are being
investigated as a means of preheating water for producing steam. Collecting biogas
(methane from landfills) for generating electricity is also being investigated, as is wind
energy. Mr. Baier also noted that researchers in the Institute for Social Research have
been engaged to advise on how to motivate people to make behavioral changes in their
work environments.
Regent Richner asked if the report considered environmental emissions related
to transportation due to commuting. Mr. Baier responded that those emissions were
considered but were not included in the report because the University could not control
how people choose to come to work. This is an important regional issue; however, he
pointed out that such programs as van pools do reduce emissions for commuting.



ï~~December Meeting, 2007

Public Comments
President Coleman called on Mark Shahinian, who was speaking on "Silver
Certification for the new Law School building" (an agenda-related topic).
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent McGowan, chair of this
committee, reported that she, Regent Maynard, and Regent Deitch had considered three
agenda topics. They first met with Associate Vice President Hank Baier and Mark
Eboch, manager for real estate and space information, to review the annual lease
portfolio for FY2007. The next session was a financial and operational update for the
University of Michigan Press, involving Provost Terry Sullivan, Associate Provost Phil
Hanlon, and Dean Janet Weiss. The committee then met with Carol Senneff, executive
director of University Audits, for a bi-monthly audit update.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of this committee, reported that he, Regent Darlow, Regent Newman, and Regent
Taylor met first with Provost Sullivan about some new student transition initiatives and
about developments in higher education in the area of financial aid. Associate Vice
President Laurita Thomas presented the University's annual salary report and discussed
employment issues and retention rates. The final topic was a discussion with Interim
Vice President and General Counsel Gloria Hage and Assistant General Counsel Tom
Blessing regarding laws that apply to governing boards. The committee also worked on
its 2008 agenda.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.

considered best for Michigan and for MSA, and thanked him for his work in student
government. She noted that the incident had led to discussions and self-evaluation
about attitudes toward disabilities, and that students are exploring the possibility of
presenting campus-wide events about the broader issues raised by this incident. She
welcomed Mohammad Dar as the new MSA president.



ï~~December Meeting, 2007

ï~~December Meeting, 2007

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted seven faculty
retirement memoirs.   Executive Vice President Kelch called attention to the
accomplishments of retiring professor Rowena Matthews, as did President Coleman.
Richard W. Bailey, Ph.D., professor of English language and literature in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on
December 31, 2007.
Professor Bailey received his A.B. degree from Dartmouth College in 1961, and
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Connecticut in 1963 and 1965,
respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in
1965, and was promoted to associate professor in 1971 and professor in 1976. In 2002 -2007 he held an appointment as the Fred Newton Scott Collegiate Professor of English.
As one of the most distinguished and respected scholars in English language
studies, Professor Bailey is a pre-eminent cultural historian of the English language,
one of the leading experts on the use of English around the world, and a highly
accomplished scholar of lexicography. He has been deeply committed to developing
effective language arts curricula at all levels and fostering equal educational access and
opportunities for speakers of English no matter what their educational background. In a
world where the power of standard English is not always questioned and the history of
English not well understood, Professor Bailey has been a strong advocate for the
recognition of "other Englishes," the acceptance of multilingualism and language
change, and the critical importance of linguistic tolerance.
Professor Bailey is the author of three scholarly monographs and more than 170
articles and reviews. He has edited more than ten books, including a ground-breaking
hypertext edition of a Renaissance diary. As a teacher and mentor, he encouraged
students to explore the language they see and hear around them, to pursue innovative
research using new technologies, and to apply their understanding of language variation
and change to the social, political, and educational questions of their generation.
Within the University, he received the Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award in
1988 and the John D'Arms Award for Distinguished Graduate Mentoring in the
Humanities in 2002. He has served as president of the American Dialect Society,
president of the Dictionary Society of North America, and editor of the journal,
Dictionaries.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Richard W. Bailey
professor emeritus of English language and literature.
Gorman L. Beauchamp, Ph.D., associate professor of humanities, College of
Engineering, and adjunct associate professor of English, Department of English
Language and Literature, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from
active faculty status on December 31, 2007.
Professor Beauchamp received his B.A. degree from Baylor University in 1961,
his M.A. degree from the University of Houston in 1965, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1972. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a
visiting lecturer in humanities in 1970, and was promoted to lecturer in 1971, assistant
professor in 1974, and associate professor in 1978. He was appointed adjunct associate
professor of English in 1985.
Professor Beauchamp began his career as a Shakespearean scholar, but broadened
his interests to other areas, including nineteenth and twentieth-century American



ï~~December Meeting, 2007

literature. He published a book on Jack London and many essays in distinguished
scholarly journals on London and other authors, including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman
Melville, Horatio Alger, Mark Twain, and Henry James. He also published regularly in
the field of utopian studies and lectured worldwide on imaginary ancient and modem
utopian communities. He was associate editor of the journal Alternative Futures and
served on the editorial board of Utopian Studies, and in 2002 he received the
Distinguished Scholar Award from the Society of Utopian Studies. Like George Orwell,
a figure he much admired, Professor Beauchamp wrote and lectured with utmost clarity
about books which engage social issues of cultural significance, especially the literary
treatment of class, money, and success. His students have benefited from his patient and
good-humored exposition of important texts ranging from Renaissance lyrics to
contemporary tracts and manifestos.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Gorman L. Beauchamp
associate professor emeritus of humanities.
Brenda L. Johnson, B.A., M.L.S., associate university librarian, will retire from
the University Library on December 31, 2007.
Ms. Johnson received her B.A. degree from Muskingum College in 1975 and her
M.L.S. degree from Rutgers University in 1980. From 1980-85, she held librarian
positions at Rutgers University Libraries. She joined the University of Michigan faculty
in 1985 as a senior associate librarian, and was promoted to interim associate director for
public services in 1998 and librarian and director for public services in 1999. She was
named associate university librarian in 2004 and served as interim co-university
librarian during 2006-2007.
In her role as associate university librarian for public services, Ms. Johnson was
responsible for policy development, evaluation and planning of public services, resource
allocation and personnel actions, and other activities that maintain and enhance the
provision of library services to the campus community. She was directly responsible for
the leadership and direction of 19 libraries with over 200 full-time staff. Ms. Johnson
was strongly committed to advancing scholarship, as evidenced by the broad array of
services, collections, and outreach initiatives developed under her leadership. Among
these were the Field Librarian Program, which places librarians directly in the instruction
and research environment of their area of expertise. She also developed the University
Library's Instructor College, which strengthens the instruction skills of librarians and
prompted the creation of for-credit courses taught by librarians. In 2003, this program
received the Innovation in Instruction Award from the Association of College and
Research Libraries.
Ms. Johnson positioned Michigan's library system to stay abreast of the emerging
needs of its users by embracing technology as a powerful academic resource. Her focus
on integrating library resources into web applications resulted in increased student access
to materials and services. Her open style, collaborative spirit, and positive sense of
purpose have positioned Michigan to be a leader in defining the Library of the future.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service by
naming Brenda L. Johnson associate university librarian emerita.



ï~~December Meeting, 2007

Nancy S. Karp, B.S., A.M.L.S., senior associate librarian in the Kresge Business
Administration Library at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, will retire from active
faculty status on January 18, 2008.
Ms. Karp received her B.S. degree from Wayne State University in 1963 and her
A.M.L.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1968. She joined the University of
Michigan faculty in 1968 as a librarian III in the Kresge Business Administration Library,
and was promoted to associate librarian in 1972 and senior associate librarian in 1980.
Over the course of her 39-year career, Ms. Karp has proven to be an exceptional
reference librarian, serving as a beacon for students, faculty and staff in the Stephen M.
Ross School of Business. The quality of her reference work has been acknowledged in
the prefaces of doctoral dissertations and faculty publications. Through her selection of
print and electronic resources, she has also contributed to the richness of research
materials at the Kresge Library. As manager of the reference services department for a
number of years, she created and refined documentation that is essential for finding and
using print and electronic resources. Ms. Karp has also been a tremendous supporter of
the Ross School's action-based learning programs such as MAP ("Multidisciplinary
Action Projects"). Her thorough approach to evaluating databases has led to numerous
improvements in these important resources.
Ms. Karp served the library during its transformation from a paper-centric facility
to one that is nearly completely electronic, and wrote three articles on managing and
using CD-ROM resources when this technology was new in libraries. She has
participated actively in professional associations and has given numerous course-related
presentations to students in the Stephen M. Ross School of Business and School of
Information.
The Regents now salute this faculty member for her dedicated service by naming
Nancy S. Karp senior associate librarian emerita.
Rowena G. Matthews, Ph.D., G. Robert Greenberg Distinguished University
Professor of Biological Chemistry and professor of biological chemistry in the Medical
School; professor of chemistry and research professor, Program in Biophysics, College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts; and research professor, Life Sciences Institute, will retire
from active faculty status on December 31, 2007.
Professor Matthews received her B.A. degree from Radcliffe College in 1960 and
her Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan in 1969. She joined the Department of
Biological Chemistry as a research investigator in 1974, and was promoted to assistant
professor in 1975, associate professor in 1981, and professor in 1986. She was appointed
assistant research biophysicist in the Biophysics Research Division in 1978, and was
promoted to associate research biophysicist in 1981, research scientist in 1988 and
research professor in 2001. She was appointed the G. Robert Greenberg Distinguished
University Professor of Biological Chemistry in 1995, and in 2002 she was appointed
professor of chemistry, Department of Chemistry, and research professor and one of six
charter faculty in the Life Sciences Institute.
Professor Matthews is internationally recognized for her research on folate and
vitamin B12 metabolism. She and her colleagues identified the gene that makes
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), one of the enzymes involved in
managing blood homocysteine levels that are of biomedical importance in cardiovascular
disease, strokes, and birth defects.  Professor Matthews received the University's



ï~~December Meeting, 2007

Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award in 1996 and was the Henry Russel Lecturer in
2003. She has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences (2002), the Institute of
Medicine (2004), and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2005).
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for her dedicated
service by naming Rowena G. Matthews the G. Robert Greenberg Distinguished
University Professor Emerita of Biological Chemistry, professor emerita of biological
chemistry, professor emerita of chemistry, and research professor emerita.
John S. McReynolds, M.D., professor of molecular and integrative physiology,
Medical School, retired from active faculty status on November 30, 2007.
Dr. McReynolds received his B.A. degree from Princeton University in 1960 and
his M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School in 1965. From 1965-67 he was a
postdoctoral fellow at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and from 1967-75
a postdoctoral and special fellow, then research scientist, in the Laboratory of
Neurophysiology, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH). He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor of physiology in 1974, and was promoted to associate professor in 1977 and
professor in 1986.
Dr. McReynolds' research focused on retinal neurophysiology in invertebrate and
vertebrate retinas. His work on information processing in the vertebrate retina contributed
to understanding the role of neuromodulator substances regulating synaptic transmission
between neurons in the retina during dark and light adaptation. His research was

extensively due to the extremely high cost estimates it generated. It incorporates a
"build your own" approach to achieve the highest level of security and lowest possible
risk; this approach emerged as the best approach upon analysis of all of the options. He
noted that the location on North Campus is convenient and suitable for expansion.
Most of the costs involved are in the built-in redundancies that will allow continuous
operations of the health system if local utility supplies are interrupted. It was noted that
seismic design requirements have been included in the project.

Vice President Forrest informed the Regents that the name of the Institute for
Labor and Industrial Relations (ILIR) is being changed to the Institute for Research on
Labor, Employment, and the Economy (IRLEE), and its research scope and mission is
being changed to advance knowledge about the major forces restructuring the economy
that are reverberating internationally, nationally, and locally. The new IRLEE will be
organizationally integrated into the Business and Industrial Assistance Division,
resulting in a shift of the organizational home and reporting relationship for the new
institute from the School of Social Work to the Office of the Vice President for
Research, with joint oversight by that office and the Office of the Vice President for
Government Relations.



ï~~December Meeting, 2007

Sally J. Churchill
Vice President and Secretary of the University



ï~~JANUARY MEETING, 2008

The University ofMichigan
Ann Arbor
January 17, 2008
The Regents convened at 3:20 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill,
Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Interim Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Interim Vice President Hage, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little,
Vice President May, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice
President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order.  She commented on the
retirement of Coach Lloyd Carr and the hiring of Coach Rich Rodriguez. She noted
that because of the ongoing construction project at Michigan Stadium, it was necessary
to find a new location for the spring 2008 commencement. The alternate, off-campus
site that was chosen had been selected primarily because it was large enough to
accommodate as many guests as allowed in previous years. However, now that students
have made it clear that their first priority is to graduate on the UM campus, the issue is
being revisited and all possible options are being explored.
President Coleman announced that on January 21 and throughout the month,
lectures, performances, films, and panel discussions will take place to commemorate
the life and legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. She thanked those responsible for
planning and coordinating these activities.
President Coleman then called on Vice President Forrest to present the annual
report on research and scholarship for 2007.
Annual Report on Research
Vice President Forrest reported that in FY 2007, research spending at the
University totaled $823 million. Federal funding comprised about 72% of this amount,
which is about the same percentage as the previous year. University support accounted
for 16%, and 4.7% of the total was provided by industry. He noted that support from
industry was up 15% from the previous year, and this sector represents a significant
opportunity for growth.
Vice President Forrest noted that the University supports social sciences
research and arts and humanities projects through the Faculty Grants and Awards
Program. He highlighted some of the programs established by the Office of the Vice
President for Research (OVPR), including the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Energy
Institute, established in 2006, which is helping to meet the challenge of satisfying
energy requirements with renewable resources, and the Institute for Research on Labor,
Employment, and the Economy, which will analyze and have an impact on the future of
the state's changing regional economies and labor force.



ï~~January Meeting, 2008

Vice President Forrest commented that a major focus of the Office of the Vice
President for Research (OVPR) is encouraging engagement by the University research
community with the business and industrial sector. Improved incentives for inventors to
establish companies to license their inventions have been put into place, and the
indirect cost rate for industrial contracts has been reduced. Furthermore, all of the
administration's share of licensing revenue has been targeted toward furthering
interactions with the industrial sector in an effort to grow relationships with and
funding by this sector. Vice President Forrest also pointed out that an important step in
improving the University's relationship with the corporate and business communities
will be to encourage and recognize faculty for their work in these areas, including
recognition in the tenure process. As an initial step, the OVPR has established the
Distinguished University Innovator Award recognizing faculty entrepreneurs.
Vice President Forrest also commented on the establishment of the Business
Engagement Center which will provide a single point of entry for business and industry
to learn about opportunities for working with the University. The University is also
participating in the Michigan Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative, a partnership
between all Michigan public universities and philanthropic foundations which will
contribute to the state's economic revival by providing support for new technology
companies emerging from the universities.
Annual Report of Senate Advisory Conunmmittee on University Affairs (SACUA)
Professor Charles Smith, chair of SACUA, spoke on the theme of academic
freedom and shared governance. He described the structure of the central faculty
governance system and reviewed some recent activities of the Senate Assembly and its
committees. He reviewed some of the major concerns of SACUA and the Senate
Assembly, which include improving communication and consultation between the
faculty, the Regents, and the executive officers. He noted that the Regents are each
being invited to meet individually with SACUA and these meetings have been very
productive. Other concerns include documenting the importance of shared governance
in the paper "Principles of Faculty Involvement in Institutional & Academic Unit
Governance at the University of Michigan," revision of faculty grievance procedures,
increased participation by elected faculty in the design and redesign of benefits
programs, and improved evaluation by the Committee on the Economic Status of the
Faculty (CESF) of faculty salaries and benefits programs.
Regent Maynard requested that the faculty continue to work to integrate the
annual reports of each campus's Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty so
that they use the same methodology and reporting methods. Professor Smith responded
that faculty are aware that improvements are needed in this area and have been working
to make them.
Conunmmittee Reports
It was noted that the committees had not met that day so there would be no
committee reports.

will be accessible anywhere in the world.
Regent Deitch commented that two students had recently addressed the Regents
at public comments about the need for such services, and he commended the provost
for acting promptly to address their concerns.
Retirement Memoirs. No faculty retirements were reported this month.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial statement for Juha
Heinonen, professor of mathematics.



ï~~January Meeting, 2008

The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Juha Heinonen, professor of mathematics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, who died of kidney cancer on October 30, 2007, at the age of 47.
Professor Heinonen was born in the small town of Toivakka in central Finland.
He enrolled in the University of Jyvaiskylai in 1980 and received his Ph.D. degree in
1987. His thesis was on non-linear potential theory. He first came to the University of
Michigan in 1985 to spend a semester as a visiting graduate student, and returned in
1988 for a three-year appointment as a post-doctoral assistant professor of mathematics.
In 1992, he accepted a tenure-track assistant professor position, and was promoted to
associate professor in 1994, and professor in 2000. From 2004-07, he also served as
associate chair for graduate studies in the Department of Mathematics.
An internationally esteemed mathematician, Professor Heinonen was a
leading figure in geometric function theory. He co-authored two books and more
than 60 research papers, many of which laid the foundation for a new branch of
mathematics, now known as analysis on metric spaces. Among numerous awards,
he addressed the 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians, and in 2004, he
was inducted into the Finnish Academy of Science. An inspirational teacher and
generous collaborator, Professor Heinonen was widely admired by the countless
young mathematicians he mentored, including the eight doctoral students for
whom he served as thesis advisor.
When Professor Heinonen first arrived in Ann Arbor in 1988, he intended to
stay for only a short period. However, his plans changed when he met his future wife,
Karen Smith, a first-year graduate student of mathematics. They married in 1991, and
she joined him on the mathematics faculty in 1996. In addition to his wife, Karen,
Professor Heinonen is survived by his older daughter, Sanelma, born in 1998, his twins,
Tapio and Helena, born in 2003, his mother, his sister, and his niece.
Professor Heinonen is deeply mourned by his family, friends, and many
colleagues in the mathematics department, who have established the Juha Heinonen
Memorial Graduate Student Fellowship to continue his legacy as a mentor to young
mathematicians.
Degrees. There were no actions with respect to degrees this month.
Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent White, seconded by
Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
The Regents then turned to consideration of the regular agenda.
Report of University Internal Audits, October 2007-November 2007
Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the report of the Office of
University Audits activities for the period October 1, 2007 through November 30, 2007.
Alternative Asset Commitments
Executive Vice President Slottow informed the Regents of the following followon investments with previously approved partnerships: $40 million to Blum Strategic
Partners V, L.P.; Â~15 million to Moorfield Real Estate Fund II, L.P.; and $35 million to
TCV VII, L.P.



ï~~January Meeting, 2008

Alternative Asset Commitment
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved commitment of up to $20 million from the Long Term Portfolio to
Matrix Partners China, L.P.
Cash Overlay and Transition Manager
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent Newman, the Regents
unanimously approved Standish Mellon as a manager to implement overlay and
transition management strategies on the University's behalf.
Refinancing of a Portion of the Commercial Paper and Financing of New Projects
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved adoption of a resolution authorizing the executive vice president
and chief financial officer or the associate vice president for finance, or the treasurer to
develop the terms, and negotiate and execute the legal documentation for the financing
with the assistance of the underwriter and outside legal counsel; obtain and approve a
final proposal for the bonds; and obtain and accept a final proposal for any "swaps,"
and any liquidity requirements for the University's variable rate debt, and execute and
deliver the required documentation for the transaction. The resolution is included as an
appendix to these proceedings.
Martha Cook Building Roof Replacement
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the Martha Cook Building Roof Replacement Project as
described, and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding construction
contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute Building First Level Laboratory
Renovations
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent McGowan, the Regents
unanimously approved the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute First Level
Laboratory Renovations Project as described, and authorized issuing the project for
bids and awarding construction contracts providing that bids are within the approved
budget.
Central Campus Area 2008 Utility Tunnel Replacements
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the Central Campus Area 2008 Utility Tunnel Replacements
project as described, and authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding
construction contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Ford Nuclear Reactor Decommissioning Project
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that this project, which began in
2004, is nearly complete. However, the total costs will exceed the approved budget by
$4.6 million, due mostly to the concrete cutting and removal operations requiring far
more effort and equipment than had originally been anticipated, and the fact that there
is only one approved facility in the country for disposal of low-level radioactive waste.



ï~~January Meeting, 2008

These factors, along with higher than anticipated costs for rigging, shipping, and
disposal of this waste, increased the total project cost.
Executive Vice President Slottow pointed out that projects coming in over
budget is a very rare occurrence: of the 734 capital projects completed during the last
five years, only 8 of these have been over budget and the remaining were on budget or
under budget, returning $51 million back to capital project budgets. On a motion by
Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the
revised budget for the Ford Nuclear Reactor Decommissioning Project, as described in
the Regents Communication.
32.47 Acres of Vacant Land Located in Livingston County, Brighton, Michigan
On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved acquisition of 32.47 acres of vacant land located at Karl Greimel
Drive and Challis Road in Livingston County, Brighton, Michigan, at the price of
$6,986,250, subject to the University satisfying itself with the environmental condition
of the site and otherwise completing due diligence.
300 North Ingalls Building Geriatric Center Relocation Renovations
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved the 300 North Ingalls Building Geriatric Center Relocation
Renovations Project as described, and authorized issuing the project for bids and
awarding construction contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman announced that the agenda includes 5 conflict of interest
items, each of which requires 5 votes for approval. These would be considered as a
block, in one vote.
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved the following agreements.
Approval of Purchase from The Big Picture Partners
The Regents approved a purchase by the School of Social Work of strategic
planning services from  The Big Picture Partners.    Because Christie Nordhielm,
founding member and partner of The Big Picture Partners, is also a University of
Michigan employee, this purchase falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.  The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1. The parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and its
School of Social Work and The Big Picture Partners.
2. The purchase is strategic planning services to develop an actionable strategy that
can be implemented over the next five years. The plan will include assessment of
core skills, identifying organizational objectives, resource allocation rules, buy-in
from stakeholders and metrics. The estimated overall cost of these services is
$20,000.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Christie Nordhielm, a University of
Michigan Ross School of Business employee as a clinical associate professor of
marketing, is a founding member and partner of The Big Picture Partners.



ï~~January Meeting, 2008

Approval of Purchase from M1DTW LLC
The Regents approved purchase of design services by the Taubman College of
Architecture + Urban Planning from M1DTW LLC. Because Christian Unverzagt, a
University of Michigan employee, is also a member of M1DTW, this purchase falls
under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. The parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and its
Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning and M1DTW.

GENERAL REVENUE BONDS AND PROVIDING FOR
OTHER MATTERS RELATING THERETO
WHEREAS, the Regents of the University of Michigan (the "Issuer") is a constitutional body
corporate established pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, as
amended, with general supervision of The University of Michigan (the "University") and the control and
direction of all expenditures from the University's funds; and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties and in order to properly serve the needs
of students attending the University, the Issuer has authorized the acquisition, construction, installation
and equipping of the capital improvements described in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Project"); and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued its General Revenue Bonds (the "Outstanding
Bonds"), in several series, and other obligations secured by a lien on General Revenues, and has reserved
the right to issue additional series of General Revenue Bonds, secured on a parity basis with the
Outstanding Bonds and other obligations by General Revenues (as defined in Trust Agreements pursuant
to which the Outstanding Bonds were issued); and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has previously issued and has outstanding bonds, notes or other
obligations (collectively, the "Senior Lien Indebtedness") payable from and secured by liens on certain
revenue streams of the University, including housing revenues, Medical Service Plan Revenues
(sometimes known as Patient Care Revenues), and it may be appropriate and economic to refund all or a
part of the Senior Lien Indebtedness; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has issued and has outstanding Commercial Paper Notes, Series G (the
"Series G Notes"), and Series E (Taxable), (the "Series E Notes", and together with the Series G Notes,
the "Notes"), which are payable from and secured by General Revenues and it may be appropriate and
economic to refund all or a part of the outstanding principal of the Series G Notes; and
WHEREAS, the financing of all or a portion of the Project and the refunding of a portion of the
Senior Lien Indebtedness and the Series G Notes through the issuance of General Revenue Bonds will
serve proper and appropriate public purposes; and
WHEREAS, in the exercise of its constitutional duties, and in order to control and direct
prudently expenditures from the University's funds, the Issuer determines it is necessary and desirable to
authorize the issuance of General Revenue Bonds (the "Bonds") in order to provide funds which, together
with other available funds, will be used to pay all or part of the costs of the Project, the costs of
refinancing a portion of the Senior Lien Indebtedness and the Series G Notes, and costs incidental to the
issuance of the Bonds and the refinancing; and
WHEREAS, a trust indenture (the "Trust Indenture") must be entered into by and between the
Issuer and a trustee (the "Trustee") to be designated by an Authorized Officer (hereinafter defined),
pursuant to which the Bonds will be issued and secured; and
WHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Authorized Officers to negotiate the sale of the Bonds
with an underwriter or group of underwriters to be selected by an Authorized Officer (collectively, the
"Underwriter") and to enter into a bond purchase agreement (the "Bond Purchase Agreement") and, if
deemed appropriate, a Remarketing Agreement (the "Remarketing Agreement") or a Broker Dealer
Agreement (the "Broker Dealer Agreement") with the Underwriter setting forth the terms and conditions
upon which the Underwriter will agree to purchase the Bonds and the interest rates thereof and the purchase
price therefor; and
WHEREAS, in order to be able to market the Bonds at the most opportune time, it is necessary
for the Issuer to authorize the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Associate Vice
President for Finance, and the Treasurer (each an "Authorized Officer") or any one of them individually,
to negotiate, execute and deliver on behalf of the Issuer, the Trust Indenture, the Bond Purchase



ï~~January Meeting, 2008-Appendix

Agreement, the Remarketing Agreement or Broker Dealer Agreement, and other related
documents, to establish the specific terms of the Bonds and to accept the offer of the Underwriter to
purchase the Bonds, all within the limitations set forth herein; and
WHEREAS, the Issuer has full power under its constitutional authority for supervision of the
University, and control and direction of expenditures from the University funds, to acquire, construct,
furnish and equip the Project, to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project and the costs of refinancing
a portion of the Senior Lien Indebtedness and the Series G Notes by issuance of the Bonds, and to pledge
General Revenues (as hereinafter defined) for payment of the Bonds;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN, AS FOLLOWS:
1. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to determine (i) the specific amount of the cost of each
component of the Project to be financed from the proceeds of the Bonds, (ii) the portion of the Series G
Notes to be refinanced using the proceeds of the Bonds, and (iii) the portion of the outstanding Senior
Lien Indebtedness to be refinanced using the proceeds of the Bonds, based on whether such refinancing
would produce interest costs savings, more favorable debt service schedules,        more flexible
documentation or a more favorable security structure for the Bonds, and to cause to be called for
redemption such of the Senior Lien Indebtedness as is appropriate and consistent with the foregoing
objectives. Subject to the Issuer's policies regarding approvals of capital projects, any Authorized Officer
may subsequently approve additional components of the Project and specify that such additional
components shall be financed in whole or in part from the proceeds of the Bonds, upon which occurrence
such components shall thereupon become components of the Project hereunder.
2. The Issuer hereby authorizes the issuance, execution and delivery of the Bonds in one or more series
to be designated GENERAL REVENUE BONDS, with appropriate series designations, if any, in the
aggregate original principal amount to be established by an Authorized Officer, but not to exceed the
principal amount necessary to produce proceeds of        Two     Hundred Thirty Million Dollars
($230,000,000), plus the amount, if any, required to refund any portion of the Senior Lien Indebtedness
and costs related to the refunding. The Bonds shall be dated as of the date or dates established by an
Authorized Officer, and shall be issued for the purpose of providing funds which, together with other
available funds, will be used to pay all or a portion of the costs of the Project, all or a portion of the costs
of refinancing a portion of the Series G Notes, all or a portion of the costs of refinancing a portion of the
Senior Lien Indebtedness and the costs related to the issuance of the Bonds and the refinancing, including
capitalized interest, if any for such period as an Authorized Officer may determine appropriate, and bond
insurance premiums, if appropriate. The Bonds shall be serial Bonds or term Bonds, which may be
subject to redemption requirements, or both, as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the first
maturity shall be no earlier than July 1, 2007 and the last maturity shall be no later than December 31,
2043. The Bonds may bear no interest or may bear interest at stated fixed rates for the respective
maturities thereof as shall be established by an Authorized Officer, but the weighted average yield
(computed using the stated coupons and the stated original offering price) for the Bonds shall not exceed
7.0% per annum, and the Bonds may be issued in whole or in part as capital appreciation bonds, which
for their term or any part thereof bear no interest but appreciate in principal amount over time at
compounded rates (not in excess of 7.0% per annum) to be determined by an Authorized Officer.
Alternatively, all or part of the Bonds may bear interest at a variable rate of interest for all or a portion of
their term, and the variable rate of interest shall not exceed the lesser of the maximum rate permitted by
law or the maximum rate, if any, to be specified in the Trust Indenture. In addition, all or part of the
Bonds may be issued in related series, one of which bears interest at a variable rate and one of which
bears interest at a residual rate determined by subtracting the variable rate from the fixed rate paid by the
Issuer, but the combined rate on such Bonds, taking the two related series together, which shall be
determined by an Authorized Officer, shall not exceed 7.0% per annum. The Bonds may be subject to
redemption or call for purchase prior to maturity at the times and prices and in the manner as shall be
established by an Authorized Officer, but no redemption premium shall exceed 3% of the principal
amount being redeemed unless the redemption price is based on a "make whole" formula, in which case
no redemption premium shall exceed 12% of the principal amount being redeemed. Interest on the Bonds
shall be payable at such times as shall be specified by an Authorized Officer. The Bonds shall be issued
in fully registered form in denominations, shall be payable as to principal and interest in the manner, shall



ï~~January Meeting, 2008-Appendix

be subject to transfer and exchange, and shall be executed and authenticated, all as shall be provided in
the Trust Indenture. The Bonds shall be sold to the Underwriter pursuant to the Bond Purchase
Agreement for a price to be established by an Authorized Officer (but the Underwriter's discount,
exclusive of original issue discount, shall not exceed 0.7% of the principal amount thereof) plus accrued
interest, if any, from the dated date of the Bonds to the date of delivery thereof.
In relation to the debt service on the Bonds, or in relation to debt service on any portion of the Senior
Lien Indebtedness or of the Outstanding Bonds, the Authorized Officers may, at any time, on behalf of
and as the act of the Issuer, enter into an interest rate swap, cap, forward starting swap, option, swaption,
rate lock or similar agreement or agreements (collectively, the "Swap Agreement") with a counter-party
or counter-parties to be selected by the Authorized Officer. Such Swap Agreement shall provide for
payments between the Issuer and the counter-party related to interest on all or a portion of the Bonds, the
Senior Lien Indebtedness or the Outstanding Bonds, or to indexed or market established rates. If the
Swap Agreement is entered at approximately the same time as the issuance of the Bonds, the expected
effective interest rates on the Bonds, taking into account the effect of the Swap Agreement, shall be
within the limitations set forth herein. Any Swap Agreement in the form of an option, swaption or
forward starting swap, may, if the Bonds to which such agreement relates are not ultimately issued, be
required to be terminated, with a possibility of a resulting termination payment due by the University.
Any or all of the Bonds may be made subject to tender for purchase at the option of the holder thereof.
The obligation of the Issuer to purchase any Bonds subject to tender options may be made payable from
General Revenues, from available cash reserves of the University, subject to such limitations as may be
specified in the Trust Indenture, or from a letter of credit, line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement
or other liquidity device, or one or more of the same, or any combination thereof (collectively, the
"Liquidity Device"), all as shall be determined by an Authorized Officer. The Liquidity Device, or any
part thereof, may also be used to provide liquidity for any other indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer,
including the Notes, the Outstanding Bonds, any variable rate Senior Lien Indebtedness and any variable
rate Hospital Revenue Bonds. Any reimbursement obligation for draws under the Liquidity Device shall
be a limited and not a general obligation of the Issuer, payable from, and may be secured by a pledge of,
General Revenues. Any portion of the Liquidity Device which provides liquidity for any Senior Lien
Indebtedness or Hospital Revenue Bonds may, but shall not be required to, be additionally or
alternatively payable from, and may be secured by a lien on, any revenue stream securing the obligations
for which the liquidity is provided. Any Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and
on behalf of the Issuer, any agreements or instruments necessary to obtain, maintain, renew or replace,
and provide for repayments under, any Liquidity Device deemed by such officer to be required for the
purposes of this Resolution. In the alternative, any or all of the Bonds may be subject to rights on behalf
of the holders thereof to tender their Bonds for purchase by the market through an auction procedure,
subject to a specified maximum interest rate not in excess of the lesser of the maximum rate specified by
law or the rate specified in the Trust Indenture.
Any Bonds authorized and issued hereunder, may, at any time, upon direction of an Authorized Officer,
be subsequently converted to another mode or structure authorized hereby, either through procedures
established in the Trust Indenture pertaining thereto, or through the issuance hereunder of refunding
Bonds to refund and replace the outstanding Bonds to be converted. Any such refunding Bonds issued
hereunder shall be subject to the terms, conditions and limitations contained in this Resolution. Any
Authorized Officer is authorized to execute and deliver, for and on behalf of the Issuer, any documents or
instruments, including but not limited to, any amendments to the Trust Indenture, necessary or convenient
for the purpose of accomplishing the conversion as described in this paragraph.
3. The Bonds, and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement and the Liquidity Device, if
any (except as specifically provided otherwise in Section 2 hereof), shall be limited and not general
obligations of the Issuer payable from and secured, by a lien on the General Revenues (as shall be defined
in the Trust Indenture in a manner generally consistent with the definition thereof contained in the Trust
Agreements pursuant to which the Outstanding Bonds were issued), subject only to the senior liens on
portions of General Revenues securing the respective series of Senior Lien Indebtedness ( until each
respective series of such Senior Lien Indebtedness is paid or defeased in accordance with its terms). The
lien on General Revenues securing the Bonds shall be on a parity basis with the lien securing the Notes
and the Outstanding Bonds. The Bonds and the obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement and



ï~~January Meeting, 2008-Appendix

the Liquidity Device, if any may also be payable from and secured by a lien on moneys, securities or
other investments from time to time on deposit in certain funds created pursuant to the Trust Indenture or
agreements entered into in connection with the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device.
No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal amount of or interest or premium on the Bonds,
the Swap Agreement or the Liquidity Device, or any claim based thereon against the State of Michigan,
or any officer or agent thereof or of the Issuer or the University, as individuals, either directly or
indirectly, nor, except as specifically provided in the Trust Indenture or the instruments entered into in
connection with the Swap Agreement or the Liquidity Device, if any, against the Issuer, nor shall the
Bonds and interest with respect thereto, or any obligations of the Issuer in connection with the Swap
agreement or Liquidity Device, if any (except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 2 hereof),
become a lien on or be secured by any property, real, personal or mixed of the State of Michigan or the
Issuer, other than the General Revenues and the moneys from time to time on deposit in all or part of the
funds established by the Trust Indenture or the agreements entered into in connection with the Swap
Agreement or Liquidity Device, if any.
Any pledge of General Revenues, and funds specified in the Trust Indenture or agreements entered into in
connection with the Swap Agreement or Liquidity Device, if any, shall be valid and binding from the date
of the issuance and delivery of the Bonds or such agreements, and all moneys or properties subject
thereto which are thereafter received shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without
physical delivery or further act. The lien of said pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties
(other than the holders of any outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations secured by a senior or parity
lien on any portion General Revenues) having a claim in tort, contract or otherwise against the Issuer,
irrespective of whether such parties have notice of the lien.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any obligations of the Issuer under the Swap Agreement
or any agreement with respect to the Liquidity Device may, if determined appropriate by an Authorized
Officer, be payable and secured on a subordinated basis to the Bonds and other General Revenue
obligations of the Issuer, or may be unsecured.
4. The right is reserved to issue additional bonds, notes or other obligations payable from and secured on
a parity basis with the Bonds from the General Revenues, upon compliance with the terms and
conditions, if any, as shall be set forth in the Trust Indenture.

ï~~FEBRUARY MEETING, 2008

The University ofMichigan
Ann Arbor
February 14, 2008
The Regents convened at 3:20 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Maynard, McGowan, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Vice President Harper, Interim Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice President
Kelch, Interim Vice President Hage, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regents Deitch and Newman were absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She reported that earlier in the
day, legislation had been approved in the state legislature to allow students and others
who are non-citizens to obtain driver's licenses. She also commented on concerns that
have been raised in Congress about the size and uses of its endowment. She pointed
out that 20% of the total endowment is committed to a variety of forms of student
financial aid, and the University welcomes the opportunity to respond to questions that
have been raised.
President Coleman also announced that she would be leading a delegation of
University faculty to Ghana and South Africa in the coming weeks that will visit eight
university campuses. She also noted that on February 28, 2008, the University
Symphony Orchestra will be performing at Carnegie Hall in New York.
Regarding commencement, President Coleman said that, based on feedback and
suggestions received from graduating seniors, the 2008 spring commencement will be
held on the Diag.
President Coleman called attention to the recommended appointment of Suellyn
Scarnecchia as vice president and general counsel, effective July 1, 2008.
President Coleman then called on Regent Taylor
Regents' Resolution in Honor of Lloyd Carr
Regent Taylor read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan extend warm and
heartfelt congratulations to Lloyd Carr upon his retirement as head
coach of the Michigan football team.
Coach Carr joined the University of Michigan staff in 1980. He
served 15 years as an assistant coach under Bo Schembechler and Gary
Moeller before being appointed head coach in 1995. During his 13 years
as head coach, Coach Carr's teams compiled an impressive 122-40 win


ï~~February Meeting, 2008

loss record and won five Big Ten championships. After his
undefeated 1997 team  brought the University its first national
championship in 49 years, Coach Carr was named national coach of the
year by six different organizations in 1998.
Coach Carr is also an exemplary leader and University citizen
off the field. An active supporter of women's athletics, he has endowed a
full scholarship that is presented annually to a female student-athlete.
The annual Women's Football Academy and "Carr's Wash for Kids,"
community events initiated by Coach Carr, have raised tens of thousands
of dollars for the Comprehensive Cancer Center and Mott Children's
Hospital. Coach Carr and his wife, Laurie, also serve as co-chairs of
the "Champions for Children" campaign, which to date has raised $50
million for the new C.S. Mott Children's and Women's Hospital.
Shortly before leading the Wolverines to a thrilling victory in the
final game of his career at the Capital One Bowl on January 1, 2008,
Coach Carr was named the 2007 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year. This
award honors a coach who is successful not only on the field, but who
also emphasizes that winning isn't everything, and that the game of
football is more important for building character and shaping lives than
winning trophies and setting records. It is difficult to imagine a more
deserving recipient of this prestigious honor than Coach Carr, a former
teacher, who has shown his players through words and deeds the
importance of learning, philanthropy, and community service. Coach
Carr exemplifies the principle: Extraordinary performance comes only
to individuals who are devoted to something larger than themselves.
The Regents wish Lloyd Carr, a Michigan Man of the highest
order, all the best as he and Laurie embark on this new phase of their
lives.
There was a standing ovation as Coach Carr came to the podium to accept the
resolution.
Coach Carr thanked the Board, recalling that he had received a previous
resolution ten years ago, in 1998, after his team won the 1997 national championship.
He expressed appreciation to the Regents and President Coleman for never having put
pressure on him during the intervening ten years, noting that "it isn't that way
everywhere." He thanked everyone for all the support they had provided during his
tenure.
Another round of applause followed.
Regent White thanked Coach Carr and emphasized how much he has meant to
the University of Michigan as a role model, coach, and educator who has always
realized the importance of making the student athlete a better person. She also
commented on the example and precedent set by his and Laurie's philanthropy. Regent
White also thanked Laurie Carr, who was in the audience, for her role in supporting
Coach Carr and in pursuing philanthropic and other projects in her own right.



ï~~February Meeting, 2008

Dean's Report: School of Art and Design
President Coleman introduced Dean Bryan Rogers of the School of Art and
Design.
Dean Rogers observed that within the school, the focus has evolved from "art
and design" to "creative work." He noted that the school, founded in 1974, is nearly
unique in being a freestanding art and design school within a major research university.
The school's creative work serves as a public interface for the University, and is
ultimately judged in a public, rather than academic context.
Dean Roger's report highlighted the "Arts on Earth" project, a collaborative
effort of all of the academic units on North Campus (School of Music, Theatre &
Dance, College of Architecture and Urban Planning, School of Art and Design, and the
College of Engineering). He noted that that during the past 8 years, the School of Art
and Design has been completely restructured and has become more integrated, with
three primary objectives: education, making creative work, and bringing creative work
into the world at large. The school's reaccreditation review, completed in November
2007, was extremely positive, with the accreditors finding that "if there was an option
to start over from scratch, this is the program that would be built.
Dean Rogers described the newly reconstituted B.F.A. program, in which
students have individual majors and complete a senior integrative project during the last
year. There are several new and innovative interdisciplinary or joint B.F.A., M.F.A.,
and Ph.D. programs. He noted that the school has 475 undergraduate students, 30
graduate students, and 40 faculty members. A number of the school's faculty members
have joint appointments in other University units, and some faculty from outside the
school have joint appointments in art and design. Eventually, plans call for an
international experience to be a required element of the B.F.A. program.
Dean Rogers described the school's facilities, which include faculty studios,
graduate student studios, galleries in Ann Arbor and Detroit, and a virtual gallery. He
noted that the school is working to increase its endowment, increase its undergraduate
enrollment, and eventually to secure a new facility more suitable to its current
programs.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent McGowan, chair of this
committee, reported that she and Regent Maynard had covered three agenda items with
Executive Vice President Slottow and others. Carol Senneff, executive director of
University audits, and Associate Vice President Peggy Norgren, gave the regular bimonthly audit update. Executive Vice President Kelch and UMHHC administrators
Doug Strong, Dave Morlock, and Tony Denton reviewed the UMHHC 10-year strategic
capital plan update, and Provost Sullivan and Associate Provost Phil Hanlon presented
the FY09 General Fund Budget overview and outlook.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of this committee, reported that he, Regent Darlow, and Regent Taylor covered
three agenda items: Athletic Department compensation issues, with Athletic Director
Bill Martin and CFO Jason Winters; laws applicable to governing boards, with Interim

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted a memoir for George
E. Johnson, professor of economics.
George E. Johnson, Ph.D., professor of economics in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2007.
Professor Johnson received his B.S. degree from Babson College in 1960, and
his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966. He
joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant professor of economics in
1966, and was promoted to associate professor in 1970 and professor in 1976. From



ï~~February Meeting, 2008

1976-91, he held an additional appointment as a research scientist in the Institute of
Public Policy Studies.
Professor Johnson has written on a wide range of policy-related topics. His
earliest work focused on labor unions, including strikes and the effects of unions on the
wages of both union members and other workers. He then studied returns to schooling,
emphasizing school quality as well as number of years completed. Another series of
studies looked at lifetime earnings among academics and promotion patterns of female
faculty. In other work, he assessed the potential impact of affirmative action proposals
and cautioned that standard estimates of the effects of job-retraining may overstate their
true benefits. More recently, he turned his attention to the growing wage inequality and
declining real wages of those at the bottom of the wage distribution, studying the
consequences of both technical change and increased international trade. In recognition
of his many contributions to the field of labor economics, Professor Johnson was
elected a fellow of the Society of Labor Economists in 2006.
Within the Department of Economics, Professor Johnson taught courses in
macroeconomics, human resource policy, benefit-cost analysis, and policy modeling,
along with graduate courses in labor economics and human capital. Thousands of
undergraduate students took his introductory course in macroeconomics, and many
went on to major in economics. He was director of the Master of Arts in Applied
Economics Program from 1988-99 and 2001-03.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming George E. Johnson
professor emeritus of economics.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported this month.
Degrees. President Coleman submitted a recommendation for an honorary
doctor of laws degree to be awarded to Njabulo Ndebele, vice-chancellor of the
University of Cape Town, South Africa.
Provost Sullivan submitted for approval the December 2007 doctoral degree list,
final degree lists for December 2007 commencements, and approval of changes to
previously approved degree list.

Executive Vice President Slottow called on Sue Gott, University planner. Ms.
Gott displayed a site plan illustrating the structure's placement on the designated site on
North Campus, noting that its location is within the area designated for such purposes
on the master plan and that it fits well into the existing topography. She introduced Ed
Koplin, principal, Xnth, Inc., and Jan K. Culbertson, AIA, principal, A3C-Collaborative
Architecture.



ï~~February Meeting, 2008

Mr. Koplin discussed the physical characteristics of the building, noting that it
is highly energy efficient and is "future-proof' for new technology. The structure will
accommodate multiple capacity expansions within its existing footprint, and contains a
highly redundant mechanical electrical system. Ms. Culbertson gave the architectural
presentation, displaying and describing floor plans for its two stories, along with a
rendering of the exterior. She noted the building exceeds regional seismic requirements
and is designed to withstand 200 mile/hour wind loads and resist tornadoes. It is selfsustaining for 24 hours and could be sustained for long periods with water and fuel
deliveries. It has been designed to be a highly efficient, secure, yet aesthetically
pleasing facility.
Regent White moved approval of the schematic design for the University of
Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Data Center Project as presented at the meeting.
Regent Maynard seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

within the approved budget.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman announced that the agenda includes 5 conflict of interest
items, each of which requires 5 votes for approval. These would be considered as a
block, in one vote.
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the following agreements:
Authorization for the University to approve Athletic Department Summer Camp
Contracts
The Regents authorized the University of Michigan Athletic Department to
allow its head coaches to operate summer camps using the University's athletic
facilities, with the coaches paying all expenses, as described in the Regents
Communication.    Because the head coaches are also University of Michigan
employees, the summer camp contracts fall under the State of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:



ï~~February Meeting, 2008

1. Parties to the contracts are the following head coaches:  Joe McFarland
(wrestling), Kevin Borseth (women's basketball), Mark Rosen (volleyball),
Amanda Augustus (Wolverine Tennis LLC) (tennis), Matt Anderson (water polo),
Mark Rothstein (crew), Andrew Sapp (golf), Chris Bergere (Diving), Kurt Golder
(men's gymnastics), James Henry (speed & agility), Fred Laplante (track), Jim
Richardson (Wolverine Swim Camp Inc.) (swimming), Red Berenson (Red
Berenson's Hockey Camp Inc.) (hockey), John Beilein (John Beilein's Michigan
Basketball School) (men's basketball), Steve Burns (Michigan Men's Soccer
LLC) (men's soccer), Debbie Rademacher (2007 only) (Michigan Girls Soccer
Camp) (women's soccer); Rich Maloney (Rich Maloney Michigan Baseball
Camps LLC) (baseball), Carol Hutchins (Carol Hutchins LLC) (softball), Jennifer
Brundage (Jennifer Brundage LLC) (softball 2), Nancy Cox (97 Score) (field
hockey), Bev Plocki (Michigan Gymnastics Camp Inc.) (women's gymnastics),
Mike McGuire (distance), and Lloyd Carr (2007 only) (Wolverine Technique
School) (football).
2. Under the terms of the contracts, the coaches, individually or through a company
owned wholly or in part by the coach, will contract with the University for use of
athletic facilities, according to a standard rental schedule and standard terms and
conditions for athletic facility use. In 2007, the Athletic Department received
compensation of $30 per camper plus utility charges, except for the Wolverine
Technique School (Lloyd Carr), which provided lump sum compensation of
$12,000. In 2008, the compensation for all camps will be $31 per camper plus
utility charges. The 2008 agreements do not yet include women's soccer and
football.
3. The coaches' pecuniary interest arises from their ownership interest in the summer
camps.
Approval of Purchases from Peaceful Dragon School
The Regents approved the purchase of Tai Chi and Qigong class registration
and instruction, respectively, from Peaceful Dragon School for wellness programs
sponsored by MFit Health Promotion Division. Because the founder, owner, and
director of Peaceful Dragon School, Wasentha Young, is also a University of Michigan
employee, these purchases fall under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.
The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. The parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and its
MFit Health Promotion Division and Procurement Services and Peaceful Dragon
School.
2. The purchase is class registration offered through MFit for a 15% discount and onsite class instruction in tandem with wellness programs over the next three years.
The overall payment of reimbursed class registrations is not to exceed $20,000 and
cost of on-site instruction is not to exceed $1,000.
3. The pecuniary interest arises from the fact that Wasentha Young, University of
Michigan Health System employee as a health educator for the Program for
Multicultural Health, is founder, owner, and director of Peaceful Dragon School.
Amendment to Option Agreement between the University of Michigan and
Biotectix, LLC
The Regents approved an amendment to an option agreement with Biotectix,
LLC, to add the following technology file to its existing option agreement: UM File
No. 3376, "Conducting Polymer Nanotubes for Precisely Controlled Drug Release."
Because David Martin, Sarah Richardson-Bumrns, and Jeffrey Hendrix, partial owners of
Biotectix, are also, respectively University of Michigan professor, post-doctoral
researcher, and student, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:



ï~~February Meeting, 2008

1. Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and Biotectix, LLC.
2. Patent Option terms include giving Biotectix an option to obtain an exclusive
license with the right to grant sublicenses. Biotectix will pay for ongoing patent
expenses, perform technical diligence, and provide a business plan that describes
Biotectix's intention and ability to develop and commercialize the licensed
technology. Terms of the subsequent license agreement would include a royalty on
sales and reimbursement of patent costs. The University will retain ownership of the
licensed technology and may continue to further develop it and use it internally. No
use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University employees,
is obligated or contemplated under the agreement.  Standard disclaimers of
warrantees and indemnification apply, and the contract may be amended by consent
of the parties. University procedures for approval of these changes will be followed
and additional conflict of interest review will be done as appropriate.
3. The pecuniary interests of Dr. Martin, Dr. Richardson-Burns, and Mr. Hendricks
arise from their ownership interest in Biotectix.
Master Agreement between the University of Michigan and EMAG Technologies,
Inc.
The Regents approved a master agreement with EMAG Technologies, Inc.
("EMAG") under which the University will participate in various projects that EMAG
will support independently or from grants from federal agencies related to technology
licensed or optioned to EMAG by the University. Because Dr. Kamal Sarabandi, a
University of Michigan employee, is also an owner of EMAG, this agreement falls
under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is
provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and EMAG Technologies,
Inc.
2. The University will enter into a master agreement with EMAG that will cover
standard procedures for performance of projects as well as provisions implementing
University and federal policies related to intellectual property and publication. The
mater agreement will cover an initial five-year period with a total authorization not
to exceed $2,000,000. The University will use standard sponsored project
accounting procedures to determine the cost of each project. Budgets will be
reviewed and approved by authorized representatives of each department and
school/college where projects are to be performed. EMAG has supported eleven
projects at the University since its inception. The master agreement will allow the
University and EMAG to specify projects that the University will conduct under the
terms of the master agreement. Since research projects are often amended, the
master agreement includes provisions for changes in time, amount, and scope of
each supported project. University procedures for approval of each project will be
followed and additional conflict of interest review will be done on a project-byproject basis.
3. Dr. Kamal Sarabandi's pecuniary interest arises from his status as an owner of
EMAG. His role in each project will be described in a project statement and a
conflict of interest management plan.
Master Agreement between the University of Michigan and ElectroDynamic
Applications, Inc.
The Regents approved a master agreement between the University of Michigan
and ElectroDynamic Applications, Inc. ("ElectroDynamic") under which the University
will participate in various projects that ElectroDynamic will support independently or
from grants from federal agencies related to technology licensed or optioned to
ElectroDynamic by the University. Because Alec D. Gallimore and Brian E. Gilchrist,
University   of  Michigan     employees, are     also  co-founders    and  co-owners    of
ElectroDynamic, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest



ï~~February Meeting, 2008

Statute.    The following    information   is provided    in  compliance with     statutory
requirements:
1. Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and ElectroDynamic
Applications, Inc.
2. The University will enter into a master agreement with ElectroDynamic that will
cover standard procedures for performance of projects as well as provisions
implementing University and federal policies related to intellectual property and
publication. The master agreement will cover an initial five-year period with a total
authorization not to exceed $2,000,000. The University will use standard sponsored
project accounting procedures to determine the cost of each project. Budgets will be
reviewed and approved by authorized representatives of each department and
school/college where projects are to be performed. ElectroDynamic has supported
five projects at the University since its inception. The master agreement will allow
the University and ElectroDynamic to specify projects that the University will
conduct under the terms of the master agreement. Since research projects are often
amended, the master agreement includes provisions for changes in time, amount,
and scope of each supported project. University procedures for approval of each
project will be followed and additional conflict of interest review will be done on a
project-by-project basis.
3. Alec D. Gallimore's and Brian E. Gilchrist's pecuniary interest arises from their
status as co-founders and co-owners of ElectroDynamic. Their roles in each project
will be described in a project statement and a conflict of interest management plan.
The Regents then turned to Public Comments.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from David A. Mikelonis, alumnus, on a proposal
to honor the memory of alumnus Steve O'Rourke.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:35 p.m. The
next meeting is scheduled for March 20, 2008.

"State") and the Regents of the University of Michigan, a Michigan constitutional body corporate (the
"Educational Institution"), providing for the rights, duties and obligations of the Authority, the State and
the Educational Institution with respect to the Educational Institution's Student Activities Building and
the site therefor (the "Facility") during the construction, renovation and/or equipping of the Facility and
prior to the conveyance of the Facility to the Authority, (b) the conveyance of the Facility to the
Authority, (c) a lease (the "Lease"), by and among the Authority, the Educational Institution and the
State, for the purpose of leasing the Facility to the State and the Educational Institution and (d) an
easement and/or other agreement (the "Easement Agreement") between the Authority and the Educational
Institution, if necessary and/or desirable in connection with access, parking, utilities, pedestrians,
encroachments, and/or other matters pertaining to the interactions between the Facility and real property
owned by the Educational Institution, and (ii) providing for other matters related thereto.
WHEREAS, the Authority has been incorporated under and pursuant to the provisions of Act
No. 183, Public Acts of Michigan, 1964, as amended ("Act 183"), for the purpose of acquiring,
constructing, furnishing, equipping, owning, improving, enlarging, operating, mortgaging and
maintaining buildings, necessary parking structures or lots and facilities, and sites therefor, for the use of
the State, including institutions of higher education created pursuant to Section 4, 5, 6 or 7 of Article 8 of
the Michigan Constitution of 1963 (the "State Constitution"), or any of its agencies; and
WHEREAS, the Educational Institution has been maintained and created pursuant to Sections 4
and 5 of Article 8 of the State Constitution; and
WHEREAS, the State and the Educational Institution desire that the Authority finance the
acquisition, construction, renovation and/or equipping of the Facility in consideration of (i) the
Educational Institution granting a license to the Authority to enter upon the site of the Facility (the "Site")
in order to undertake such construction, renovation and/or equipping, (ii) the Educational Institution
undertaking on behalf of the Authority the oversight of such construction, renovation and/or equipping
and (iii) the Educational Institution conveying the Facility to the Authority on or prior to the date of its
completion, and the Authority is willing to provide such financing in consideration of the items described
above; and
WHEREAS, in accordance with the Construction and Completion Assurance Agreement, the
State and the Educational Institution desire that the Authority acquire the Facility on or prior to the date
of its completion, and lease the same to the State and the Educational Institution, and the Authority is
willing to acquire the Facility and lease the same to the State and the Educational Institution; and
WHEREAS, the Site is presently owned by the Educational Institution, the Facility will be
constructed by the Educational Institution on behalf of the Authority, and it is intended that the Site and
the Facility be conveyed to the Authority by the Educational Institution; and



ï~~February Meeting, 2008 - Appendix

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Facility by the Authority for use by and lease to the
Educational Institution and the State is necessary in order for the State and the Educational Institution to
carry out necessary governmental functions and to provide necessary services to the people of the State as
mandated or permitted by constitution and law, and the use of Act 183 to accomplish such
acquisition represents the most practical means to that end at the lowest cost to the State and the
Educational Institution; and
WHEREAS, Section 7 of Act 183 provides that the Lease shall be approved by the Authority, by
the State Administrative Board of the State and by concurrent resolution of the Legislature of the State
concurred in by a majority of the members elected to and serving in each house and if the Lease is for an
institution of higher education existing or created pursuant to Section 4, 5, 6 or 7 of Article 8 of the State
Constitution, then in addition, the Lease shall be authorized by the institution of higher education and
signed by its authorized officer and, accordingly, it is necessary that the Educational Institution authorize
and approve the Lease; and
WHEREAS, if it is determined that (i) the Educational Institution will require for future use
certain easements through the Facility, (ii) the Authority and the Educational Institution will require an
agreement to share a common structural wall, (iii) the Authority will require an easement over real
property owned by the Educational Institution so that the Authority has sufficient parking available in
connection with the reasonable use of the Facility, and/or (iv) the Authority and/or the Educational
Institution will require other easements and/or agreements pertaining to the Facility and/or real property
owned by the Educational Institution (such as, but without limitation, easements and/or agreements
pertaining to pedestrian traffic, utility lines, and/or encroachments), then in order to meet any such
requirement, it may be necessary for an authorized officer of the Educational Institution to approve an
Easement Agreement or Easement Agreements to provide for such easements and/or agreements;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
MICHIGAN THAT:
1. The plans for the Facility, as filed with the Educational Institution, are hereby approved.
2. The Educational Institution hereby authorizes and approves the Construction and Completion
Assurance Agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A, and the Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer of the Educational Institution is hereby authorized and directed to execute
and deliver, at the appropriate time, the Construction and Completion Assurance Agreement in
substantially the form attached as Exhibit A for and on behalf of the Educational Institution. Such officer
is hereby authorized to approve such changes in and modifications to the Construction and Completion
Assurance Agreement as do not materially adversely affect the Educational Institution.
3. The conveyance of the Site and the Facility to the Authority in accordance with the Construction and
Completion Assurance Agreement is hereby approved, and the then seated President and the Executive

directed to execute and deliver a warranty deed in substantially the form attached as Exhibit B and bills of
sale to accomplish such conveyance in such form as may be from time to time approved by such officers.
4. The Educational Institution hereby authorizes and approves the Lease in substantially the form
attached as Exhibit C, and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Educational
Institution is hereby authorized and directed to execute and deliver the Lease in accordance with the
Construction and Completion Assurance Agreement and in substantially the form attached as Exhibit C
for and on behalf of the Educational Institution and such officer is hereby designated as an authorized
officer of the Educational Institution for purposes of Section 7 of Act 183. Such officer is hereby
authorized to approve such changes in and modifications to the Lease as do not materially alter the
substance and intent thereof as expressed in the Lease and the request for action submitted to the Regents
in connection therewith; provided such officer is not hereby authorized to approve a change in the Lease
with respect to the range of rental, the description of the Facility or the material financial obligations of



ï~~February Meeting, 2008 - Appendix

the Educational Institution contained in the Lease approved herein. The Educational Institution hereby
determines that the maximum rental in the amount described below is reasonable and the authorized
officer is hereby authorized to approve in the Lease, as executed, rental in annual amounts determined by
the final appraisal of "True Rental," but not exceeding $516,000 in any 12-month period and a lease term
of not exceeding 40 years.
5. If in connection with the entering into of the Lease, and if the Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer of the Educational Institution determines that (i) the Educational Institution will require
for future use certain easements through the Facility, (ii) the Authority and the Educational Institution
will require an agreement to share a common structural wall, (iii) the Authority will require an easement
over real property owned by the Educational Institution so that the Authority has sufficient parking
available in connection with the reasonable use of the Facility, and/or (iv) the Authority and/or the
Educational Institution will require other easements and/or agreements pertaining to the Facility and/or
real property owned by the Educational Institution (such as, but without limitation, easements and/or
agreements pertaining to pedestrian traffic, utility lines, and/or encroachments), then such officer is
hereby authorized and directed to execute and deliver an Easement Agreement or Easement Agreements
if necessary in order to meet any such requirement.
6. The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Educational Institution is hereby
authorized and directed to take or cause to be taken all other actions, including, without limitation,
making requests of and approving requests from the Authority and the State and signing certificates,

desirable under the circumstances to accomplish the purposes of the transactions authorized in this
Resolution.
7. The Educational Institution further confirms its obligations to perform the duties and obligations
specified in the Construction and Completion Assurance Agreement (only upon its execution by the
authorized officer of the Educational Institution) and the Lease (only upon its execution by the authorized
officer of the Educational Institution) and acknowledges that such obligations do not depend upon
passage of title to the Facility to the Educational Institution without consideration upon termination of the
Lease. The Educational Institution hereby recognizes that it would execute and deliver the Lease even if
title to the Facility would not pass upon termination of the Lease.
8. The Educational Institution recognizes that the Authority shall pay for costs of the Facility in an
amount not in excess of $5,751,600.
9. All ordinances, resolutions and orders or parts thereof in conflict with the provisions of this Resolution
are, to the extent of such conflict, hereby repealed.
10. This Resolution shall be effective immediately upon its adoption.

ï~~MARCH MEETING, 2008

The University ofMichigan
Ann Arbor
March 20, 2008
The Regents convened at 3:20 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, McGowan, Newman, Richner, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Vice President Harper, Interim Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice President
Kelch, Interim Vice President Hage, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little, Vice
President May, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regents Maynard and Taylor were absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She reported that the University
had recently received two significant gifts, first from Dorothea Wyatt, a founding
faculty member of the University of Michigan-Flint, who made a bequest of $6 million
to the UM-Flint's Department of History, the largest gift ever received from an
individual in the campus's 52-year history. The second gift, of $200,000, is from
Regent Andrea Fischer Newman and her husband, Frank, to support the C.S. Mott
Children's and Women's Hospital and the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics.
President Coleman noted that Regent Newman's participation as an active volunteer in
the Michigan Difference campaign has helped move the campaign forward in countless
ways.
President Coleman also gave an overview of her recent trip to Ghana and South
Africa with a delegation of University faculty members. She said they had had
extremely productive talks with university leaders in both countries about continuing
and expanding partnerships in a number of areas, and she described some of the
specific projects that are underway.
President Coleman concluded her comments by calling for a moment of silence
in memory of Leo Felty, Jr., a masonry worker who died on February 28, 2008, while
working on the Museum of Art expansion project.
Dean's Report: School of Music, Theatre & Dance
President Coleman introduced Dean Christopher Kendall of the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance.
Dean Kendall began by playing a clip from a recent performance by the
University of Michigan Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. He noted that the
school is in a unique position as a top-ranked, comprehensive, performing arts school at
a top-ranked public university, and has 66 degree programs in research, performance,
and education in music, theatre, and dance. The school is the most selective
undergraduate unit at the University with an enrollment of 1,040 (75% undergraduate
students and 25% graduate students), of which 11% are from underrepresented groups.
He listed some of the accomplishments of recent alumni, current students, and faculty.



ï~~March Meeting, 2008

Dean Kendall reviewed the school's programs in all of the performing arts
disciplines, highlighting its renowned programs in musical theatre, composition, and
conducting. He noted that the school stages over 400 events annually, most of which
are free and open to the public and help enrich the life of the University and the region.
He also pointed out that the school offers more class credits to non-majors than any
other unit at the University except the College of LS&A.
Dean Kendall spoke about the Arts on Earth initiative involving all of the North
Campus units and the Arts Enterprise program, a collaboration between students in the
Ross School of Business and Music, Theatre & Dance, as well as other initiatives
undertaken by the school's faculty and students that contribute to the broader
community. Among the school's challenges are widening its donor prospect pool so as
to be able to compete in scholarship offerings, performing arts facilities, and other areas
with its more highly endowed peers. The goal is to "make the Michigan experience
affordable for those intellectually curious, artistically talented, civically engaged
students in the arts" who want to attend the University of Michigan.
University of Michigan Alumni Association Update
President Coleman introduced Steve Grafion, executive director of the Alumni
Association. Mr. Grafion observed that a major function of the Alumni Association is
to engage alumni so that they are supportive of the University. He listed some of the
association's current initiatives, noting that 90% of the opportunities currently available
to alumni to engage them with the University have been developed in the past 5-10
years.  These initiatives include informative podcasts, quarterly video updates,
broadening the focus of local alumni clubs, and developing innovative means of
engaging current students. Mr. Grafton described some of the on-campus activities
currently underway in the latter area, and said they have been very successful. One
such event, a "coffee and bagels" open house at the Alumni Center, attracted over 900
students.
Mr. Grafion also described other alumni activities that are occurring both on the
national and international levels. He noted that for the first time, the Alumni
Association had participated in the Michigan Difference campaign and had exceeded its
goal of raising funds for need-based scholarships. He commented that while
membership numbers have been static in recent years, engagement of alumni has
steadily increased. The addition of a new benefit of library access for certain Alumni
Association membership levels is expected to help increase membership.
Mr. Grafion concluded with observations of what he hears from alumni as he
travels around the country.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent McGowan, chair of this
committee, reported that she and Regent Maynard had covered the following agenda
items with Executive Vice President Slottow and others: Sarbanes Oxley work plan
status, follow up and review of FY07 external audit and FY08 external audit plan (with
Peggy Norgren, associate vice president for finance, Carol Senneff, executive director
of University Audits, Brent Haase, internal controls compliance manager, Cheryl



ï~~March Meeting, 2008

Soper, University controller, Dave Morlock UMHHC chief financial officer, and Rick
Stover, John Mattie and Bill Stulginsky, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP.), and the
regular bi-monthly internal audit update with Carol Senneff.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of this committee, reported that he, Regent Darlow, Regent Newman, and Regent
White first met with Dean Ball of the School of Education and Provost Sullivan for the
first in an ongoing review of institutional quality and outcomes-related topics with the
schools and colleges. The committee was updated by Provost Sullivan on on-going
dean and director searches, and then was briefed by Provost Sullivan and President
Coleman on the recent reports of academics and student athletes at the University. He
said that "the committee expressed support for the ongoing efforts of the administration
and the Athletic Department to assure our student athletes' academic success and the
actions the University has taken to conduct a thorough internal review and response
relating to these issues. The committee noted its particular concern over the
unauthorized release and subsequent publication of private student information without
the permission of the student involved. The last agenda item concerned a set of
proposed "housekeeping" amendments to the Regents' Bylaws.

meeting of February 14, 2008.

Established, February 1 - February 29, 2008. He announced that the University of
Michigan has achieved full accreditation in the Association for the Accreditation of

demonstrated it provides safeguards to research participants that surpass the threshold
of state and federal requirements. He thanked the committee that had worked with the
AAHRP to accomplish the review and accreditation.
University of Michigan Health System. There was no additional report from
the University of Michigan Health System.
Division of Student Affairs. There was no additional report from the Division

University of Michigan-Flint. Interim Chancellor Kay commented on the gift
from Dorothea Wyatt, noting that it will be transformative for the Department of
History and the College of Arts, Sciences and Letters. He also reported on progress
being made on construction of the campus's new residence hall, and noted that a



ï~~March Meeting, 2008

number of applications have been received from first year students. UM-Flint students
had also participated in Alternative Spring Break.
Michigan      Student Assembly          Report.       Mr. Mohammad           Dar, president of
Michigan Student Assembly, reported on recent activities and accomplishments of
MSA. He also expressed concerns on behalf of the Dearborn student body about the
proposed priority system for student football tickets. Lastly, Mr. Dar noted that the
MSA elections were underway and a newly-elected MSA president would be in place
by the time of the April Regents' Meeting.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the Report of Voluntary
Support for February 2008. He also submitted a report on IRA gifts submitted under the
Pension Protection Act of 2006. He reported that the University raised $9.3 million
through this program, far more than any other Big Ten institution. He reported that one
of the University's most devoted donors, Mary Meader, had died the past weekend at
the age of 91, and he recounted some of the highlights of her life and the importance of
her support to the University.

James K. Coward, Ph.D., professor of medicinal chemistry in the College of
Pharmacy and professor of chemistry in the College of Literature, Science, and the
Arts, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2007.
Professor Coward received his A.B. degree from Middlebury College in 1960,
his M.A. degree from Duke University in 1964, and his Ph.D. degree from the State
University of New York at Buffalo in 1967. He completed postdoctoral work at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, from 1967-69 and was on the faculties of Yale
University from 1969-79 and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) from 1979-86.
During his tenure at RPI, Professor Coward chaired the School of Science Biochemistry
Program (1980-86), was promoted to professor in 1982, and served as an adjunct
professor of biochemistry at Albany Medical College from 1984-86. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1987 as professor of medicinal chemistry, College of
Pharmacy, and professor of chemistry, College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.
A dedicated educator and outstanding scholar, Professor Coward has an
international reputation for his work in the field of medicinal chemistry, utilizing
organic chemistry to explore pharmacologically interesting biochemical problems.
Among his numerous awards, he has been named an American Cancer Society Scholar
in Cancer Research and a fellow in the Chemical Section of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science. He has served on NIH study sections and NSF panels,
and on the editorial boards of several prestigious journals. As the first chair of the
Department of Medicinal Chemistry (2000-2004) and director of the Interdepartmental
Program in Medicinal Chemistry (1998-2004), Professor Coward's leadership and
dedication to professional and graduate education enhanced the reputation of the
College of Pharmacy as one of the top pharmacy schools in the country.



ï~~March Meeting, 2008

The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated service
by naming James K. Coward professor emeritus of medicinal chemistry and professor
emeritus of chemistry.
Richard A. Gull, Ph.D., professor of philosophy in the College of Arts and
Sciences, University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on December
31, 2007.
Professor Gull received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from the University
of Iowa in 1961, 1964, and 1968, respectively. He joined the University of MichiganFlint faculty as a lecturer in 1965, and was promoted to assistant professor in 1968,
associate professor in 1972, and professor in 1997.
Professor Gull was an invaluable member of the Philosophy Department and
College of Arts and Sciences, having served twice as chair of the Philosophy
Department (1968-77 and 1994-98) and on many committees. He represented the Flint
campus on several University-wide committees, most recently serving on the Senate
Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA) from 2003-06. He was vice chair
of Senate Assembly from 2005-06 and served on the assembly's General Counsel
Advisory Committee and the Academic Affairs Advisory Committee. In recognition of
his commitment to faculty governance, Professor Gull received the Jackie Lawson
Memorial Faculty Governance Award in 2004.
Within the Philosophy Department, Professor Gull taught several very popular
courses, including Philosophy of Literature, Philosophy of Film, and the History and
Philosophy of Science. His teaching and research interests came together in his studies
of the philosophy of film and the philosophy of work. He presented the results of his
research twice at the North American Sartre Society, and also at the Conference on
Professional Ethics at the University of Dayton (2001) and the Society for the
Philosophical Study of Visual Arts of the American Philosophy Association (APA)
(1995 and 2001). He presented papers on Sartre at the APA in 1998, and on Taxi
Driver at the Conference on Ethics and Popular Culture at the University of South
Florida Ethics Center in 2003. His research and publications on film and the emotions
were well received in the philosophical community.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated service by
naming Richard A. Gull professor emeritus of philosophy.
Patricia M. Redman, M.S.L.S, librarian in the University Library, retired from
active faculty status on December 31, 2007.
Ms. Redman received her B.A. degree from Marian College of Fond du Lac in
1964, and her A.M.L.S. degree from The Catholic University of America in 1965.
From 1965-67, she was a special services librarian in the U.S. Army, and in subsequent
years she held librarian positions at Boston College, Santa Clara City Library, the
University of Iowa, Erie Community College, and St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann
Arbor. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as an associate librarian at the
Taubman Medical Library in 1991, and was promoted to senior associate librarian in
1994 and librarian in 2001. She also held an appointment as adjunct lecturer in the
School of Information and Library Studies from 1993-97.
During her tenure at the Taubman Medical Library, Ms. Redman guided many
significant changes. She embraced change, fostering a shared vision of user needs and



ï~~March Meeting, 2008

expectations, and keeping current with best practices in librarianship. When large
amounts of health-related materials became available on the Internet in the mid-1990s,
she pioneered the HealthWeb project, a collaborative effort among the libraries within
the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) to provide health information on a
variety of topics. While serving as liaison to the School of Nursing, she developed
partnerships with faculty that led to the introduction of significant library instruction
into the curriculum. As evidence-based practice became critical to the field of
medicine, Ms. Redman readily transferred those concepts to her work in the nursing
curriculum. She was an early-adopter of new technologies and brought chat reference
and other technologies to the University of Michigan Health Sciences Libraries.
One of Ms. Redman's most important legacies is the professional mentoring she
provided to many librarian colleagues. She also served in leadership roles within her
profession. She was president of the Midwest Chapter of the Medical Library
Association, chair of Librarians' Forum (the librarian faculty group on campus), and
filled other varied and significant roles within the Medical Library Association and the
University Library. Her vision, dedication, and energy will be greatly missed.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service
by naming Patricia M. Redman librarian emerita.
Barbara L. Rosen, A.M.L.S., associate librarian, retired from the University
Library on December 31, 2007.
Ms. Rosen received her B.A. degree from Wayne State University in 1966 and
her A.M.L.S. degree from the University of Michigan in 1974. She joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1974 as an assistant librarian and was promoted to
associate librarian in 1977.
For many years, Ms. Rosen was the sole cataloguer of Hebrew and Yiddish
language materials. She processed many thousands of Hebrew and Yiddish books and
periodicals for the library's Judaica collection through the mid-1990s, when the library
began to expand its Judaic studies program by adding staff and funding resources.
More than a generation of division heads, bibliographers, and cataloguers received their
initial professional training from Ms. Rosen, and many of them have advanced to
important positions working in other distinguished Judaica collections.
As a long-time member of the Association of Jewish Libraries and an active
participant in the affairs of the Jewish communities in Ann Arbor and Detroit, Ms.
Rosen cultivated contacts through these channels that significantly benefited the
Judaica collection. For example, her activity led directly to the acquisition of the
Joseph T. and Marie Adler Collection of Holocaust Materials, a collection of Judaica
realia, manuscripts, and archives of immeasurable research value. She was also a key
player in the acquisition of the Detroit Public Library's Yiddish collection, the
Midrasha Library's Yiddish and Hebrew collection, and the Shaarey Zedek Library's
Morris Adler collection. Ms. Rosen's invaluable contributions to the University
Library's illustrious Judaica and Yiddish collections, especially its Yiddish language
collection, have benefited and will continue to benefit countless scholars and graduate
students.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service by
naming Barbara L. Rosen associate librarian emerita.



ï~~March Meeting, 2008

Bertram Schnlitzer, M.D., professor of pathology in the Medical School,
retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2007.
Dr. Schnitzer received his B.A. degree from New York University in 1952, and
his M.D. degree from the University of Basle Medical School in Switzerland in 1958.
He completed his internship at Baltimore City Hospital in 1958-59, and pursued his
residency at Georgetown University Medical Center from 1959-63. During his
residency, he served as chief resident from 1961-63 and was an NCI trainee and NIH
fellow. From 1963-66, Dr. Schnitzer served as assistant pathologist at the Armed
Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, D.C. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an instructor in pathology in 1966, and was promoted to assistant
professor in 1967, associate professor in 1970, and professor in 1974.
Recognized internationally as a leader in the fields of hematology and
hematopathology, in 1976 Dr. Schnitzer received the first International Giovanni di
Guglielmo Prize in Hematology for studies on erythroleukemias. His research in
transmission and scanning electron microscopy resulted in many important publications
in Science, including a cover photo, and his publications included hundreds of other
articles in peer-reviewed journals, two books, and numerous book chapters. Dr.
Schnitzer has served on numerous committees, expert review panels, test panels, and
editorial boards, and he was president of the Society for Hematopathology in 1990. He
is much sought after as a visiting lecturer, having presented over 140 courses, lectures
and workshops throughout the world.
Dr. Schnitzer's administrative roles included serving as a consultant to the Ann
Arbor Veterans Administration Hospital and director of the Clinical Hematology
Laboratory, the   University  Health  Service  Clinical  Laboratories, and  the
Hematopathology Fellowship Training Program. He took great satisfaction from his
contributions to optimal patient care and from teaching his many residents and fellows
through the years. A number of his prot6g6s have become leaders at prestigious
institutions across the country.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Bertram
Schnitzer professor emeritus of pathology.
Linda K. TerHaar, M.S.L.S., librarian in the Shapiro Undergraduate Library,
retired from active faculty status on January 18, 2008.
Ms. TerHaar received her B.A. degree from Calvin College in 1973, her M.A.
degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1976, and her M.S.L.S. degree from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1987. She joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant librarian in the Undergraduate Library in 1987, and
was promoted to associate librarian in 1989, senior associate librarian in 1994, and
librarian in 2001. She was head of the Shapiro Undergraduate Library from 1996 until
her retirement.
Throughout her tenure, Ms. TerHaar led projects specifically geared towards
enriching the student experience. Her ongoing work with the Office of New Student
Programs has ensured the library's successful participation in summer orientation
sessions for all incoming students. Under her guidance, Caf6 Shapiro has become an
ongoing and successful venue for student writers to publicly read their works. Recently,
she worked with the LSA First-Year Seminars Program to add a for-credit course on



ï~~March Meeting, 2008

information literacy.  This exciting prospect promises to be a model for other
partnerships and connections for the library within the academy.
Ms. TerHaar's commitment extends beyond the Undergraduate Library to her
many professional contributions. She has chaired the Librarians' Forum, an on-campus
professional association for University librarians, and served as the convener for the
Library's Collection Management and Development Council. She made presentations
at national conferences, including the Association of Bi-National Centers in Latin
America and the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL). The ACRL
Guidelines for Undergraduate Libraries were developed as a result of her leadership in
the ACRL's Undergraduate Librarians Discussion Group. Ms. TerHaar's dedication to
undergraduate education and the core values of the librarianship profession will be
deeply missed.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for her dedicated service by
naming Linda K. TerHaar librarian emerita.

investments that had been made with the following, previously approved funds: $15
million (Canadian) to JOG IV, L.P.; $25 million to Canyon-Johnson Fund III, L.P.; and
15 million to Bridgepoint Europe IV, L.P.
In response to a question from Regent Newman about how the current economic
situation is impacting the University's investment portfolio, Chief Investment Officer
Erik Lundberg and Executive Vice President Slottow observed that while the
University is not immune to the current volatility in the market, its focus on risk
avoidance and having a highly diversified portfolio should lessen the impact of a major
downturn.

Diag for Spring Commencement.
President Coleman reported that the University is one of only three public
universities nationwide to receive AAA bond ratings from both Standard & Poors and
Moody's investor services. She commended Executive Vice President Slottow and his
team for their work in maintaining and strengthening the University's financial
stability. President Coleman concluded by announcing that seven University faculty

including a growing number of dual degree students and a popular undergraduate
program co-sponsored by the College of LS&A. Since 2001 the school's research
budget has tripled, to $9 million, and it has increased its external visibility and outreach
with its dean's speaker series and its first national summit on "Coping with Climate
Change."

research activities within the school, and described a number of these research projects.

director of athletic business operations Jason Winters, and the FY08 General Fund
budget outlook, with Provost Teresa Sullivan and Associate Provost Phil Hanlon. The
committee also received the hospital quarterly report.
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that the University had issued $224
million in general revenue bonds to support various University projects, and noted that

stadium project of about $2 million per year for 20 years.

chair of this committee, reported that he, Regent Darlow, and Regent Taylor attended
the meeting. They received a report from Provost Sullivan on the status of ongoing

Economy (IRLEE), which promotes new research on key issues related to labor,
employment, and the economy, and focuses on areas in which the University has
notable strengths. He reported that the formation of IRLEE has led to the broadening
of the focus of ILIR's Labor Studies Center to encompass employment, as well as work
and labor. As a result of partnerships with fellow institutions in the University
Research Corridor (URC), there is an opportunity to distribute programs formerly
administered by ILIR to the participating universities in the URC with strengths that
allow them to optimally serve each program. He said the University has reached out to
organized labor and welcomes its consultation during this time of transition.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice          President Churchill submitted       one  faculty
retirement memoir, for William Gosling, curator of the children's literature collection
and former University librarian. Regent McGowan pointed out that it was under Mr.
Gosling's leadership that the University became one of the five original Google Library
partners, and the only one that committed to digitize its entire collection.
William    A. Gosling, M.L.S., curator, Children's Literature          Collection,
University Library, and former University librarian, retired from active service on
March 31, 2008.
Mr. Gosling received his B.A. degree from Bates College in 1965, and his
M.L.S. degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1966. He served in the U.S. Army
from 1967-68, and was employed by the Library of Congress from 1969-76 and the
Duke University Library from 1976-86. Mr. Gosling joined the University of Michigan
faculty as assistant director for technical services and library systems and librarian in
1986. He was appointed interim director of the University Library in 1997 and was
named director in 1998. In 2003, his title was changed to University librarian. He
stepped down from that position in 2005, at which time he assumed the position as
curator of the Children's Literature Collection.



ï~~April Meeting, 2008

Mr. Gosling led the library forward during a period of rapid change and
dynamic technological innovation. As assistant director for technical services and
library systems, he oversaw implementation of the library's first online catalogue,
which included the conversion of 1.2 million bibliographic records into electronic
format and installation of the first computers for public use in the libraries. As director
and as university librarian, he led the library's migration to a new, integrated catalog
and acquisitions system which currently holds more than 20 million records. Under his
leadership, the University Library became nationally known for its digital library
program and became one of the five original Google Library partners, the only one to
commit to digitizing its entire collection. These efforts have secured the University
Library's position as one of the leading institutions of its kind in the world.
Within the library, Mr. Gosling oversaw a major review and restructuring of
library staff positions, and led development efforts that resulted in $10 million in gifts
in six years. Since stepping down as university librarian in 2005, his work as curator of
the Children's Literature Collection has more than doubled the size of the collection in
the Special Collections Library.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for his dedicated service
by naming William A. Gosling University librarian emeritus and curator emeritus.
Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported this month.
Degrees. There were no actions with respect to degrees this month.

Residency Classification Guidelines
Provost Sullivan informed the Regents about a revision to the military waiver
provision of the Residency Classification Guidelines (Section D) that would grant a
waiver of out-of-state tuition to regular active duty personnel who are stationed in
Michigan, even if they are living outside of the state. The revision is effective Spring
term, 2008 (additions in italics and underlined):
D. Special Waiver of Out-of-State Tuition for Regular Active Duty Military
Personnel Living or Stationed in Michigan
Regular active duty military personnel who are living or stationed in Michigan, as well
as their accompanying spouses and dependent children, will be allowed to pay in-state
tuition while they attend the University of Michigan, even though they will not be
eligible to be classified as residents under the Residency Classification Guidelines.
This waiver is available to persons in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and
Coast Guard, and to officers in the Public Health Service. When the military person
upon whom the waiver is based leaves the state, a child or spouse who remains in
Michigan enrolled full-time in high school or an institution of higher learning will
continue to be eligible to receive the waiver. Children must have completed at least the
junior year of high school prior to the military person's departure. In order to request
this waiver, the student must submit a residency application by the applicable filing
deadline and provide documentation demonstrating eligibility.

ï~~

ï~~MAY MEETING, 2008

The University ofMichigan
Ann Arbor
May 15, 2008
The Regents convened at 3:20 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Darlow, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman,
Richner, Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill,
Vice President Forrest, Vice President Harper, Interim Chancellor Kay, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Interim Vice President Hage, Vice President Lampe, Chancellor Little,
Vice President May, Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice
President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order and thanked Chancellor Little
and the Dearborn campus for hosting the meeting. She congratulated Susan Martin,
provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs at the UM-Dearborn, on her
appointment as president of Eastern Michigan University, noting that she looks forward
to working with her. President Coleman also pointed out that this would be the final
meeting attended by Gloria Hage in her capacity as interim vice president and general
counsel, and thanked her for the thoughtful and incisive counsel she had provided.
President Coleman complimented and thanked all of the staff members and
volunteers who had been involved in planning and executing the recent, historic
commencement for the Class of 2008 that had taken place on the Diag on the central
campus in Ann Arbor campus, noting that it was a spectacular event.
Dean's Report: UM-Dearborn School of Management
Kim Schatzel, dean of the UM-Dearborn School of Management, gave a
presentation describing the initiatives being undertaken by the school in service to the
businesses and citizens of southeastern Michigan. The school's focus is in keeping with
the campus's mission of having a significant and positive metropolitan impact, and
providing part-time undergraduate and graduate degree programs for working
professionals. She gave examples of how the school's applied research centers partner
with organizations in southeastern Michigan to help provide solutions to their most
difficult challenges.
Financial Aid Overview
Provost Sullivan gave a presentation on the University's undergraduate financial
aid program, pointing out that 70% of undergraduates (over 18,000 students) received
some type of financial aid in 2007-2008, and that the average award for an
undergraduate is over $13,400. The average grant equaled about 70% of the tuition for
a lower division undergraduate student. Forty-one percent of all financial aid to
undergraduates is funded from University sources, 37% from federal sources, and the
remainder from private and state sources. Grants and scholarships constitute 59% of all
financial aid, loans are 40%, and work-study funding is 1%. During the 2007-08



ï~~May Meeting, 2008

academic year, central University funds provided $66,573,699 in need-based financial
aid.
Provost Sullivan said that the University's financial aid policy is to meet the full
demonstrated financial need of all resident students who apply on time and accept the
entire financial aid package, to maintain a good balance between grants and loans in the
student's package, and to meet as much need as possible for nonresident students. She
noted that the need-based aid package makes it more affordable for low income
students to go to the University of Michigan than any other public university in the state
or in the Big Ten.
Provost Sullivan gave examples of financial aid packages for students in
specific circumstances, pointing out that the University's packages for very low income
students with expected family contributions of zero consist entirely of grants, with no
expected family contribution. This is in contrast to packages offered by Ivy League
institutions, which typically require about $4,000 in student "self-help" contributions.
For 2008-09, the maximum allowable gift aid in financial aid packages will increase by
$400 based on expected increases in federal Pell Grant funding, and the University's
general fund financial aid budget is expected to be significantly higher than the tuition
rate percentage rate increase.
Among the University's challenges are the fact that its competitors are not
affected by the effects of Proposition 2 on financial aid packages directed to minorities.
Other issues include the student loan burdens faced by graduate students, competing
against the new financial aid programs offered by private peer institutions, and the
current economic climate and lending environment.
Regent Darlow expressed how pleased she was that the financial aid programs
reflect the increasing accessibility of the University to low income students, and she
also pointed out how successful the President's Challenge had been in increasing the
amount of need-based financial aid available for undergraduate students. Vice President
May commented that in addition to the $70 million that had been raised by the
President's Challenge, another such challenge is currently underway to increase the
amount of aid for graduate and professional students.
North Campus Master Plan
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that a University planning advisory
committee chaired by Professor Homer Neal, had undertaken a study, "North Campus
Vision 2005-2025," with the goal of developing a North Campus vision and set of
planning principles. A subsequent committee, made up of students, faculty, and staff,
worked with an external consultant to execute the concepts enumerated in the North
Campus Vision, and the result was a new North Campus Master Plan.
Ms. Gott then gave a presentation on the new North Campus Master Plan. The
Master Plan incorporates four major themes identified in the vision statement: 1) to
create strong physical, functional, and psychological connections, internally within
North Campus and between it and the other campuses and to the community at large; 2)
to promote campus vitality, making North Campus more of a destination with a greater
sense of place; 3) to optimize development capacity; and 4) to respect and incorporate
environmental features into the built environment.



ï~~May Meeting, 2008

Ms. Gott used maps with overlays and photo illustrations to describe how all of
the themes are incorporated into the new plan, and included the functional use
framework with public goods, an open space framework, and a mobility framework.
The plan includes selective clearing of the Northwoods area to increase transparency,
and a possible realignment of the Bonisteel-Murfin intersection.
The framework plan indicates that there is a remaining development capacity on
North Campus of 9,000,000 to 10,000,000 gross square feet. The presentation
concluded with a depiction of how the Murfin-Plymouth Road "gateway" entrance
would look when fully developed. Regent Maynard noted the importance of continued
input by the campus community as the master plan is refined and implemented. Ms.
Gott stated that the plan provides a very broad vision and that input is continually being
sought in a variety of settings. The principles incorporated into the plan will be used to
guide any project proposal that arises.
Public Comments
The Regents heard comments from Ashley Londy, president of the Residence
Halls Association, on the proposed rates for University Housing.

Winters and Joe Parker); the proposed 2008-2009 University of Michigan Hospitals and
Health Centers (UMHHC) budget (with Executive Vice President Kelch, UMHHC
Director and CEO Doug Strong, Senior Associate Director and CFO Dave Morlock,
and Senior Associate Director and COO Tony Denton); and the bi-monthly internal
audit update (with Carol Senneff, executive director of university audits).
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Richner,
chair of this committee, reported that he, Regent Darlow, and Regent Newman attended
the meeting.  The agenda included a report from  Chancellor Little on faculty

University of Michigan Health System. There was no additional report from

Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper called attention to the
request for approval of the 2008-2009 University Housing rates. She noted that
occupancy rates for 2007-2008 had been close to 100%, and said that in setting rates,
the Housing Division attempts to keep rates as low as possible while providing a high
quality residential experience and being thoughtful stewards of the facilities. The
recommended rate increase is 4.9%, of which 2%              is committed to funding previouslyapproved elements of the Residential Life Initiative and the remainder is allocated to
cover increased costs for general operations, utilities, food, repairs, and furnishings.
She said that Mosher Jordan Hall would be re-opening this fall after being closed for
two years, as would the new Hill Dining Center. The proposed increase for Northwood
Community Apartments is 3.1%.

Guidelines. Vice President May also
agenda book on the Facilities Naming

called
Policy



ï~~May Meeting, 2008

and Guidelines, noting that it had been developed by a committee appointed by him and
Executive Vice President Slottow. The resulting policy and guidelines clarify the levels
of naming, designate which types of namings require Regental approval and which do
not, and define clear steps in the naming process, both for honorific and donor namings.
The policy, which governs all campuses, also creates the Facilities Naming Steering
Committee, chaired by the vice president for development. He reviewed the types of
namings that require Regental approval.
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that the policy will be circulated
to development officers across the university so that they can proactively identify
naming opportunities and bring them to the committee well in advance.
Regent McGowan observed that the board has historically taken a great interest
in this issue, and commented for the record, "The board takes these namings very
seriously. It feels a great sense of responsibility to the traditions and values of this
university. One of the things we requested is that the board be given early notice of
where these major namings are going." She reiterated that "there is a great interest by
this board in naming these amazing buildings, so the early notice of naming
opportunities is important."
Personnel Actions/Personnel Reports.          Provost Sullivan    submitted the
recommended promotions to the ranks of professor and associate professor for 2008 -2009, in addition to other personnel actions and personnel reports. She described the
promotions process, noting that 205 cases had been reviewed, from which emerged
recommendations of 158 instructional track cases for review and approval. She pointed
out that for the first time, the entire process was handled electronically. It was noted
that highlights of the tenure cases from all three campuses will be presented at the next
meeting.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted 17 faculty retirement
memoirs.
Arthur J. Ashe, III, Ph.D. professor of chemistry in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, and professor of macromolecular science and engineering in the
College of Engineering, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2008.
Professor Ashe received his B.A., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Yale
University in 1962, 1965 and 1966, respectively. In 1962-63 he attended the University
of Cambridge on a Henry Ford Fellowship, and he also held an N.S.F. predoctoral
fellowship from 1963-66. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor in 1966, and was promoted to associate professor in 1971 and professor in
1976. He received an additional appointment as professor of macromolecular science
and engineering in 2000.
Professor Ashe is known world-wide for his scientific work on organometallic
chemistry of the main group elements. Over a period of years he prepared a large
number of minimally or unsubstituted novel heterocycles. These syntheses, which are
concise and invariably elegant, have focused on the simplest members of new classes of
compounds. Most notable are his syntheses of the entire family of heterobenzenes:
phosphabenzene, arsabenzene, stibabenzene and bismabenzene. As a result of this



ï~~May Meeting, 2008

work, it was established that even the heaviest elements could be incorporated into
aromatic rings. Professor Ashe has also prepared important aromatic boron compounds
including 1H-borepin and boratabenzenes. He found that zirconium complexes of boron
heterocycles can be excellent catalysts for converting olefins to important plastics. His
extensive research work has been documented in 150 scientific publications.
Professor Ashe was chair of the Department of Chemistry from 1983-86. He
has trained more than 30 doctoral and postdoctoral students and large numbers of
undergraduates in research. He has been awarded external funding from a wide variety
of sources and has been recognized with an A. P. Sloan Fellowship (1972-76), the
LS&A Excellence in Teaching Award (1993), and the LS&A Excellence in Research
Award (1995).
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Arthur J.
Ashe, III, professor emeritus of chemistry and professor emeritus of macromolecular
science and engineering.
Barry A. Bogin, Ph.D., William E. Stirton Professor of Anthropology and
professor of anthropology, College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters, University of
Michigan-Dearborn, retired from active faculty status on December 31, 2007.
Professor Bogin received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D., degrees from Temple
University in 1971, 1973, 1977, respectively. Prior to joining the University of
Michigan-Dearborn, he served as an assistant professor at Wayne State University, was
a Latin American Teaching Fellow at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala in
Guatemala City, a visiting professor at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, the
University of Buenos Aires, the National School of Anthropology and History in
Mexico City, and the Technical University of Lisbon. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty as an assistant professor in 1982, and was promoted to associate
professor in 1985 and professor in 1990.
Dr. Bogin's theoretical work and research is deeply rooted in both empirical and
applied work, and has both political impact and popular appeal. He has studied growth,
health, and nutrition among Mayan children in Guatemala, and in 1992 compared those
children to Guatemalan Mayan immigrant children in the United States. He has
published more than 100 books, articles, chapters, and popular essays, and was invited

He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an associate professor of anthropology
and curator, Museum of Anthropology in 1967, and was promoted to professor in 1971.
Professor Brace is a leading scholar in biological anthropology, with research
interests spanning from our species' earliest evolution through modern scientific
understandings of race. Throughout his career, and in more than 190 academic
publications, he has been a consistent advocate for the application of a Darwinian
perspective to major questions in biological anthropology. He championed the view
that the Neanderthals are ancestral to modemrn humans, and pioneered the use of
quantitative metric data to investigate human evolutionary relationships, with particular
interest in understanding how changes in culture have affected human anatomy over the
past two million years. Professor Brace has been a strong and important voice in
critiquing and challenging simplistic biological notions of race, most recently in his
2005 book, Race is a Four-Letter Word, and more generally, through his publications
in the popular media and through public debates with proponents of creationism and
intelligent design.
A distinguished and highly-regarded teacher and mentor in both large
undergraduate lecture classes and small graduate seminars, Professor Brace has
supervised some 20 doctoral dissertations and served on numerous graduate
committees. In 2006, he was honored by the American Association of Physical
Anthropologists with its prestigious Charles Darwin Lifetime Achievement Award.

the experimental discovery of fundamental physical laws that govern the interactions of
elementary particles. He made major contributions to experiments conducted at
national and international particle accelerator laboratories, including Brookhaven
National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, Fermilab, the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, and CERN (Switzerland). These experiments yielded the discovery
of the top quark and the determination that there are three distinct neutrino species. He
was particularly noted for his ability to design and provide sophisticated electronic
devices for the detectors used in these experiments. At the beginning of his career he
developed automated scanning devices for locating and measuring tracks recorded on
bubble-chamber film. Later, he employed direct electronic detection of particle
trajectories from ionization deposited in scintillators and in gas-filled detectors. Most
recently, this all-electronic measurement technique expanded to include detectors with
nearly one million channels of custom integrated circuit electronics and large
programmable logic chips.
Professor Chapman participated in all aspects of academic life. He taught a
variety of physics courses and served on the Physics Department Executive Committee
and on many other department and university committees. For 18 years, he was the

was a postdoctoral fellow at Oxford University. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty as an assistant professor in 1969, and was promoted to associate professor in
1974 and professor in 1987.
Professor Sharp's principal area of research has been in chemical applications
of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). His early work involved studies
of relaxation mechanisms of heavy nuclei, principally tin and lead, and led to his
establishing the first absolute nuclear shielding constant scales for these heavy nuclei.
He then applied flash-induced NMR relaxation changes to the study of manganese
oxidation states in the oxygen evolving photosynthetic complex, enhancing the
understanding of manganese oxidation-reduction cycles in photosynthesis. Since
1990, Professor Sharp's research has evolved into a series of detailed studies of NMR
relaxation in molecular systems containing paramagnetic transition metal ions. Of
particular significance has been his development of a refined theoretical framework in
which experimental data can be analyzed. Much of this work has been shown to be
applicable to the development of contrast agents for clinical use in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) radiological applications.
Throughout his career, Professor Sharp has been an inspiring and enthusiastic
teacher of both undergraduate and graduate students. He particularly excelled in the

York-Peng Edward Yao, Ph.D., professor of physics in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on May 31, 2008.
Professor Yao received his B.S. degree from the University of California,
Berkeley, in 1960, and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University in 1963
and 1964, respectively. From 1964-66, he was a research associate at the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton University. He joined the University of Michigan faculty
as an assistant professor in 1966, and was promoted to associate professor in 1972 and
professor in 1978.
Professor Yao's research has focused on the theoretical description of the laws
governing the interactions of elementary particles using the methods of quantum field
theory. He was an early proponent of gauge field theories, realizing their relevance to
the description of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. He did seminal work
on the structural and phenomenological aspects of this important area of research, and
was the first to study the infrared or long distance behavior in gauge theories and its
impact on the physics of strong interactions. Professor Yao's most influential work
was the theory of effective lagrangians and low energy manifestations of heavy particle
effects. He realized very early that the description of low energy physics using the
method of effective lagrangians was fundamental, and developed many of the important
tools used in this area. Using these methods, he pioneered the calculations for physical
observable precision to a high degree in the context of the Standard Model for particle
physics. His calculations won the praise of many in the field, as they provide a basis
for the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.
A dedicated teacher and instructor of students at all levels, Professor Yao was
most known for his rigorous graduate level courses. He served on more than 30
graduate student thesis committees and chaired four committees.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming York-Peng Edward
Yao professor emeritus of physics.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted memorial statements for two
faculty members, Michael Bretz, professor of physics, and Donald Ulysses Walden,
associate professor of music (jazz studies).
Vice President Forrest commented on his long and personal relationship with
Professor Bretz, who had been a mentor and colleague. It was noted that a transcript of
these comments will be sent to his family.
Michael Bretz, professor of physics, died on April 10, 2008, after a long fight
with cancer. He was 70 years old.
A distinguished low-temperature physicist well known for his work on quasi
two-dimensional systems, Professor Bretz received his B.S. degree from the University
of California, Los Angeles, in 1961 and his Ph.D. degree from the University of



ï~~May Meeting, 2008

Washington in 1971. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1973 as an
assistant professor and was promoted to associate professor in 1977 and professor in
1986.
Professor Bretz's best known work was on the physics of adsorbed films,
particularly on graphite substrates. He performed extremely precise measurements of
heat capacities, permitting studies of very thin adsorbed layers. He did influential
experiments on phase transitions of rare gases in these conditions, which can be thought
of as a direct realization of the two-dimensional Potts model, an area of considerable
theoretical interest. His pioneering work on graphite preceded the explosion of activity
on fullerenes, though he remained keenly interested in these developments throughout
his career. He later worked on avalanches in granular materials and water droplets. His
work on sound-producing ("booming") sands included a field-trip to record the sounds,
and led to an article in Scientific American.
Professor Bretz was a dedicated, sympathetic, and humane teacher; he
supervised the doctoral theses of five graduate students, all of whom have had
successful scientific careers. His enthusiasm and wry humor communicated itself in his
classroom teaching, and he was active in introducing new concepts into the curriculum.
His colleagues will miss Professor Bretz's friendly presence, his dedication to science,
and his boundless curiosity about the natural world. As we mourn the loss of our
beloved colleague, we extend our condolences to his wife, Margaret, their two children,
and four grandchildren.

of Michigan faculty as assistant professor of music in 1995, and was promoted to
associate professor in 2002.
Professor Walden came of age in Detroit in the 1950s during that city's golden
age of modem jazz. He studied at the Larry Teal School of Music in Detroit, learning
improvisation from Detroit pianist and bebop great Barry Harris, and saxophone from
Yusef Lateef. He toured and recorded with Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, the
Temptations, and the Four Tops. In the 1980s, Professor Walden created the New
World Stage in Harmonie Park in Detroit, which became a training ground for young
musicians. In 1982, Professor Walden formed the Detroit Jazz Orchestra (DJO) out of
the need to develop a civic jazz orchestra to represent the city of Detroit. The DJO
received the Governor's Arts Award for Outstanding Achievement in the arts in 1985,
and Professor Walden received the Jazz Master Award from Arts Midwest in 1986. In
1990, he produced "Yardbird Suite" at the Detroit International Jazz Festival, a tribute
to Charlie Parker that brought together a big band, 18 strings, and a choir; the concert is
still remembered to this day.
"With his long-tall frame and distinguished carriage," wrote Mark Stryker in the
Detroit Free Press, "he was a standard bearer for jazz in Detroit, a mentor to
generations of students and a beacon of ambition and integrity for his peers." Professor



ï~~May Meeting, 2008

Walden will be remembered as an inspiring and exceptional teacher who was highly
revered by his students, and as a world-renowned jazz saxophonist and composer. He
received significant recognition for his excellence and service to the arts throughout the
state of Michigan and the jazz community.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we also extend our heartfelt
condolences to his wife, Marsha, his two daughters, Deirdre Jones and Aisha Walden,
and many relatives and close friends.

Proton Beam Radiation Therapy Center
Executive Vice President Kelch described this request for approval of the
University of Michigan Health System to participate in a consortium to develop a
proton beam radiation therapy center, according to the guidelines recently approved by
the Certificate of Need Commission on April 30, 2008. He explained that proton beam
therapy is a promising, but not yet proven, therapy for many types of cancers, which
has the potential to benefit a subset of cancer patients, most likely children and possibly
young adults. It may also be of benefit for some ocular and skull-based tumors;
however, the benefit of this therapy over the standard photon radiotherapy for prostate
cancer has not been established. Therefore, given the rising cost of health care and the
tremendous investment that a photon beam radiation therapy center will require, the
most prudent approach would be to develop a consortium approach among leading area
nonprofit hospitals.
Regent Taylor moved approval of participation of the University of Michigan
Health System in the proposed consortium of non-profit, Michigan hospitals to develop
a proton beam radiation therapy center in the state of Michigan. Regent Darlow
seconded the motion. Regent Deitch commended Dr. Kelch for his leadership on this
issue, and said that on behalf of his Regent colleagues, "You have our full support in
pushing this idea forward because it's the right thing for Michigan. This is an important



ï~~May Meeting, 2008

initiative, and I think the public should understand that." The vote was then taken, and
the motion was approved unanimously
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 4:45 p.m. The
next meeting is scheduled for June 19, 2008.

ï~~MAY MEETING, 2008 - APPENDIX B

POLICY FOR NAMING OF FACILITIES, SPACES AND STREETS
INTRODUCTION
Since the University was founded, the University's physical spaces have been named to reflect its rich
history and traditions. This policy ("Policy") and its accompanying guidelines ("Guidelines") direct how
the University's physical properties may be named and the appropriate review and approval processes.
Consult the Guidelines for Naming Facilities, Spaces and Streets ("Guidelines") for definitions.
Namings may:
* Honor individuals by recognizing exceptional contributions shaping the University;
* Commemorate University history and traditions;
* Honor long-term and significant financial contributions to the University; or
* Honor financial contributions to support the structure(s) named.
This Policy and the Guidelines will govern naming practices of all University properties, including those
located on the Flint and Dearborn campuses in instances requiring Regental approval (buildings, large
additions and wings, major exterior spaces and streets). The Board of Regents shall be informed early in
the process regarding potential facility namings. While naming may be initiated by the president,
executive officers, and others as outlined below, the Board of Regents often initiates the naming process,
particularly in cases of honorary namings of facilities for former presidents and streets for former
Regents. In instances where this Policy and the Guidelines do not require Regental approval (small
additions and expansions, large interior spaces, small exterior spaces, rooms, bricks, plaques and
benches), each campus may adopt its own policies and guidelines that parallel this Policy and the
Guidelines. This Policy and its Guidelines, however, shall control all namings on the Ann Arbor campus
and of University properties situated beyond a University campus.
I. STANDARDS FOR NAMING FACILITIES
To protect the University's interests and traditions, Regental approval is required for naming facilities.
The approval process shall be as follows:
* The vice president for development shall be responsible for maintaining a master list of facility
naming opportunities, both donor and honorary, and shall share this list periodically with the
Board of Regents, the Facilities Naming Steering Committee, and the University Planner's Office.
* The unit head or executive officer(s) originates the naming proposal consistent with the unit's
Fundraising Naming Opportunity Plan as described in the definitions section of the Guidelines; or,
if for an honorific naming, the unit head or executive officer(s) originates the naming proposal;
* The originator recommends the name to the vice president for development, as chair of the
Facilities Naming Steering Committee (as defined in the definitions section of the Guidelines);
* The Facilities Naming Steering Committee reviews and, with recommendations, forwards the
proposed name for review by the president and executive officers;
* The president and/or executive officers propose the name to the Board of Regents for approval.
A. Names for Donor Contributions Toward Facilities
1. New Construction
New facilities may be named for a donor or donors for contributions of 50% or more of the
fundraising goal for the facility or 33% or more of the anticipated project cost, whichever is greater.
When the project cost exceeds $75 million dollars, or under other special circumstances, the Facilities
Naming Steering Committee may recommend an alternative threshold for naming a specific facility,
taking into consideration the capacity of the prospect pool, and setting a naming threshold that will
maximize the fundraising potential for the project.



ï~~May Meeting, 2008 - Appendix B

2. Existing Facilities
An existing facility may be named for a donor if a gift equals 50% of replacement value, as
determined by the executive vice president and chief financial officer.
B. Facility Names to Honor Individuals
1. For individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to the University or to society
Naming a facility to honor individuals should be extraordinary, and made if:
a. The individual has had University-wide influence, or the individual has made exceptional
contributions to the nation or world; and
b. A year has passed from the time the honoree has died or been separated from the role with the
University for which the person is to be honored; and
c. A year has passed from the time of nomination (concurrent with year stated in item b.,
above).
2. For donors who have provided financial support to the University in general
In compelling cases, for financial contributions other than that defined in Section I. A. above, a
donor (whether living or deceased) may be honored through a facility name if the donor has:
a. Provided long-term, extraordinary financial support greater than other principal donors; and
b. No major facility bearing his or her name.
II. NAMING SPACES WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF FACILITIES
A. Large Additions and Wings
Large additions and wings may be named for donors or to honor individuals associated with the
University following the same standards and processes for naming University facilities set forth in section
I., above. The Board of Regents must approve the naming.
B. Small Additions and Expansions
A unit head may propose honorific or donor namings for small additions and expansions provided the
review process found in section B.1.c. of the Guidelines has been followed.
Approval process:
* The unit head or executive officer(s) originates the naming proposal consistent with the unit's
Fundraising Naming Opportunity Plan as described in the definitions section of the guidelines; or,
if for an honorific naming, the unit head or executive officer(s) drafts a naming proposal.
* The originator recommends the name to the vice president for development, as chair of the
Facilities Naming Steering Committee.
* The Facilities Naming Steering Committee reviews and, with recommendations, forwards the
proposed name for review and approval of the president and executive officers.
* Regental approval is not required unless the naming is unusually prominent, sensitive or subject to
heightened public interest.
C. Large Interior Spaces
A unit head may name large interior spaces, individual rooms and incidental items, for donors or to honor
individuals, provided the review process set forth in section B.1.c. of the Guidelines has been followed.
Approval process:
* The unit head or executive officer(s) originates the naming proposal consistent with the unit's
Fundraising Naming Opportunity Plan as described in the definitions section of the Guidelines; or,
if for an honorific naming, the unit head or executive officer(s) originates naming proposal.
* The originator recommends the name to the vice president for development, as chair of the
Facilities Naming Steering Committee.



ï~~May Meeting, 2008 - Appendix B

* The Facilities Naming Steering Committee reviews and, with recommendations, forwards the
proposed name for review and approval of the president and executive officers.
* Regental approval is not required unless the naming is unusually prominent, sensitive or subject to
heightened public interest.
Of particular importance, where donor namings are expected to represent a significant source of
construction funding, all namings of spaces within a facility must be consistent with a Fundraising
Naming Opportunity Plan developed and reviewed as set forth in section B. 1.c. of the Guidelines.
D. Major Exterior Spaces Outside Facilities (e.g.. Plazas, Fields, Malls)
Major exterior spaces that are accessible to all may receive donor or honorific namings under the same
standards and processes as provided for University facilities set forth in section I., above. The Board of
Regents must approve the naming. Major exterior spaces that are not accessible to all may receive donor
or honorific namings under the same standards and processes for large interior spaces set forth in section
II.C., above.
E. Small Exterior or Interior Spaces, Bricks, Plaques and Benches
Small exterior spaces (including courtyards), and small interior spaces (including rooms), bricks, plaques
and benches may carry honorific or donor names as determined by the unit head, provided the review
process set forth in section B. 1.c. of the Guidelines has been followed. The unit head will be responsible
for carrying out the intent of any honorific or donor naming at this level.
Approval process:
* The unit head selects the name consistent with unit's Fundraising Opportunity Plan; or, if for an
honorific naming, the unit head selects the name.
* The unit head consults with University Planner's Office for guidelines.
* No other approval is necessary.
F. University-Owned Streets and Drives
Streets and drives may only be named by the Board of Regents, on recommendation of the president or
executive officers, and are named for Regents by election (after 1852), deceased. The president or
executive officers must propose the naming for approval by the Board of Regents, following the process
set forth in section I above. When the city vacates part or all of a street to the University, the former
street name should be continued if it remains a street and should be carried over in some form if the
vacated street section is used for other purposes, such as a pedestrian mall.
III. OTHER NAMING CONSIDERATIONS
A. Propriety of donor-designated namings
Because a naming forges a permanent link in the public mind between the University and the designated
name, the University must exercise discretion and perform appropriate due diligence, based upon all the
facts and circumstances associated with a proposed gift. Care should be taken that the naming is
appropriate and desirable, whether the proposed name is the name of an individual donor or is a corporate
name or other descriptive words. The vice president for development will undertake due diligence for all
donor-designated namings. It is recognized that a donor naming is not always a personal or corporate
name. For example, fundraising drives may also result in a seemingly functional name such as the
Michigan League or the Michigan Union, in which case a renaming may be proposed only after
considering sensitivities and after consultation by the Facilities Naming Steering Committee.
B. Dual Namings
A single facility or space may be impressed with two honorific namings, or may be named in honor of
two unrelated donors, or may be named under an honorific naming and also in recognition of a donor. An
existing naming may be converted to a dual naming (i) if the dual naming does not violate a contractual
commitment of the University to any donor, (ii) following consultation and with sensitivity to the party
whose name is currently applied to the facility or space, and (iii) with sensitivity to the history and
traditions of the University. Dual namings may also be accomplished by assigning a new donordesignated name or an honorific name to either (i) an interior or exterior space situated within a larger



ï~~May Meeting, 2008 - Appendix B

interior or exterior space or facility that is already named, or (ii) an interior or exterior space or facility
encompassing a smaller interior or exterior space that is already named. These would be considered
"layered" namings.
C. Perpetuation of Name
The University is committed to retaining the name of each facility, large addition, wing, major exterior
space, street, small addition or expansion and large interior space (collectively referred to within this
paragraph as a "Facility") bearing a donor-designated name or honorific name. The name is intended to
remain for the life of the Facility regardless of any subsequent change in the occupying unit(s). If the
Facility is razed at some future date the University will recognize the honoree in an appropriate way, as
approved by the Facilities Naming Steering Committee.
IV. POLICY EXCEPTIONS
Exceptions to the policies may be made by the Facilities Naming Steering Committee, in consultation
with the associate vice president for facilities and operations and with such other University officers, if
any, as determined appropriate by the Facilities Naming Steering Committee. However, unless the Board
of Regents affirmatively directs otherwise, no exceptions shall be made to the policy guideline that the
Board of Regents must approve namings of all buildings, wings, additions, other major free-standing
facilities, major exterior spaces and streets, and in all instances where the naming is unusually prominent,
sensitive or subject to heightened public interest (excluding functional names).



ï~~MAY MEETING, 2008 - APPENDIX C

GUIDELINES FOR NAMING OF FACILITIES, SPACES AND STREETS
INTRODUCTION
These guidelines ("Guidelines") clarify definitions and further describe processes found in the University
of Michigan Policy for Naming of Facilities, Spaces and Streets ("Naming Policy").
A. DEFINITIONS
Unit Head. (1) The vice president having authority for the unit in question or the vice president's
designee. (2) In academic units, the unit head is the dean or the dean's designee.
(3) For all exterior spaces, the unit head for purposes of these Guidelines and the Naming Policy shall be
deemed to be the University Planner's Office. The University Planner's Office should also be consulted
regarding guidelines for plaques and benches.
Unit Fundraising Naming Opportunity Plan. Where gifts are expected to represent a significant
source of construction funding and may justify naming the project, the unit should develop a plan that
defines various fundraising naming opportunities ("Fundraising Naming Opportunity Plan") at and within
the facility to be constructed. This Plan should be reviewed with the Board of Regents in advance, and
before the Request for Approval of Project and Authorization to Appoint Architect (the first of the three
required Regental approvals) is submitted to the Board of Regents for approval, bearing in mind that the
Plan must necessarily remain tentative and subject to change at the outset. If the construction will require
Regental approval, the list of significant fundraising naming opportunities must be reviewed by the
Facilities Naming Steering Committee and the University Planner's Office before presentation to any
prospective donor. The vice president for development shall be responsible for maintaining a master list
of facility naming opportunities, both donor and honorary, and shall share this list periodically with the
Board of Regents, the Facilities Naming Steering Committee, and the University Planner's office.
Facilities Naming Steering Committee. The University's executive vice president and chief financial
officer ("CFO"), the provost and executive vice president for academic affairs ("provost"), the executive
vice president for medical affairs, and the vice president for development shall constitute a steering
committee ("Facilities Naming Steering Committee") responsible for implementation and oversight of
these Guidelines and the Naming Policy. The vice president for development will be considered the
administrative chair of this group.
Large Addition is a larger building component that is erected after the building's original construction
and that, although attached to a parent structure, is designed and sited in such a way, and is of sufficient
size, to appear as a discrete and almost separate structure. A large addition generally warrants exterior
signage.
Small Addition is a smaller building component that is erected after the building's original construction
and that is designed in such a way that it appears as part of the original structure. "Expansion" and "small
addition" are considered to be synonymous terms. Small additions and expansions will not generally
warrant exterior signage. If it is unclear whether an addition should be deemed a "large addition" or a
"small addition," the vice president for development, in consultation with the CFO, shall make the
determination when the matter is presented to the Facilities Naming Steering Committee.
Wing is a smaller component of a building as originally constructed or as later added which does not
appear to be structurally separate from the parent structure. Wings, however, consist of multiple elements
within a building that may include classrooms, laboratories, faculty offices, meeting rooms, an auditorium
and/or an atrium, and will generally be more than one floor if the building as a whole consists of more
than one floor. Towers, pavilions, and houses of residence halls are considered wings for the purpose of
these Guidelines.
Larger Interior Space or a "section of a facility" is a smaller component than an addition or a wing but
is of prominence within the facility and is larger than a single room (such as a classroom or conference

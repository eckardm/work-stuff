Vice-President Pierpont placed on file his monthly reports on
investment transactions, plant extension, litigation, and personnellabor relations. He also filed a quarterly report on purchases and
payment transactions over $1,000 from single sources.
In this connection, Regent Roach asked the following questions: What is a general fund order? Why were some of the
purchases not made by competitive bidding? And, what is the
nature of the consulting expenditures?
Vice-President Pierpont responded that general fund orders
were those paid only out of general funds budget, and that because
of the standarization of some products and equipment, purchases
were made without competitive bids.
Regent Nederlander questioned the Washtenaw County Legal
Aid Society item. He said it was his understanding that authorization for this expenditure should be granted by the Regents on
a yearly basis.
Regent Laro inquired into the nature of this expenditure and
the type of legal work which was done.
President Fleming stated that the Washtenaw Legal Aid
Society had already been established and in operation to give
legal advice to students when a decision was made to pay it a
yearly stipend rather than add to the staff of the Office of Student
Services.
Vice-President Johnson stated that it has proven to be a
valuable service to the students.

Regent Nederlander asked if the additional amount in the
report had already been paid and if so, who had authorized it.
Vice-President Johnson said that he would look into the matter
and include in his report to the Regents the types of cases involved.
Vice-President Overberger filed a listing of grants and contracts
for research.
President Fleming noted that these grants and contracts had
increased substantially.
Vice-President Overberger replied that they had increased by
about $9 million over last year which probably was attributable
to new areas of research and a different funding pattern.

of University Relations and Development.
Regent Nederlander remarked that the returns from direct
mail solicitation were good.

Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of twelve faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted:
Professor ELMER G. BERRY'S first contact with the University of     E. G. Berry
Michigan was as a graduate student during the period 1933-37, receiving his  Retirement
Ph.D. in the latter year upon completion of an intensive study of the
Amnicolidae of Michigan, which is still considered a landmark in the field
of malacology. After completion of his graduate studies, he had a long and
successful career as capable administrator and public health authority with
the Public Health Service, specializing in tropical diseases. Upon his retirement from this assignment in 1965, he returned to the University of Michigan,
primarily to establish the program in medical malacology, and also to participate in the teaching of parasitology. He held the combined titles of Professor
of Zoology and Curator of Mollusks, with salary provided by grants from
the National Institutes of Health. In addition to his teaching and research,
he took a keen interest in counseling students and directing individual research
projects.
Although his tenure in the Department of Zoology was relatively short,
it was highly productive. He published regularly, taught effectively, and was
constantly in demand because of his expertise in a field not represented by
other members of the faculty. He enjoyed these contacts and gave unselfishly
of his time to help others.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his service by
naming him Professor Emeritus of Zoology.
Dr. WARREN C. EVELAND, Professor of Epidemiology, has retired       W. C. Eveland
from active faculty status as of June 30, 1975, after a long and fruitful career  Retirement
in public health.
A native of California, Dr. Eveland completed undergraduate studies at
the University of California at Berkeley in 1930. In 1937, following seven
years of work in the Nevada State Hygienic Laboratory at Reno and at
Letterman Army Hospital in San Francisco, he was appointed Director of
Public Health Laboratories in the Department of Health of the Territory of
Alaska. During his four years in that position, Dr. Eveland managed to complete an M.S.P.H. degree at The University of Michigan.
In 1941, with war impending, Dr. Eveland began a long and distinguished
career in the U.S. Army Medical Service serving as chief bacteriologist in
several military installations in Alaska, the mainland U.S. and Japan. He
also found time to earn a Ph.D. in Bacteriology at the University of Maryland, completing that degree in 1952. While he was stationed in Japan between 1953-56, Dr. Eveland also served as an advisor to the Korean Government on the postwar rehabilitation of two laboratories of the Korean National
Institutes of Health. When Dr. Eveland retired from the U.S. Army in 1959
with the rank of Colonel, he was Chief of the Bacteriology and Immunology
Branch of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, D.C.
Dr. Eveland joined the faculty of the School of Public Health in 1959
as Resident Lecturer in Epidemiology where he assumed responsibility for
the teaching program in Public Health Laboratory Practice. Under Dr.
Eveland's effective direction the scope of the program was broadened, and
he made a major curriculum contribution with the development of the
Dr.P.H. program in Laboratory Practice. The program became well known
throughout the country attracting students widely from home and abroad.




14


JULY MEETING, 1975


Dr. Eveland's enthusiasm for and devotion to teaching and the personal
interest he took in his students were unequalled. Dr. Eveland was very
quickly promoted to Associate Professor in 1962 and to Professor in 1967.
Dr. Eveland's primary research interest has been in the development of
fluorescent antibody techniques and their application not only as diagnostic
procedures in the public health laboratory but also as tools in basic research.
His use of FA techniques in the biological study of organisms and their
serological variations led to invitations to a number of international symposia
where he was able to present impressive contributions.
In recognition of his distinguished career as public health educator and
practitioner, the Regents designate Dr. Warren C. Eveland as Professor
Emeritus of Epidemiology.
J. A. Gage     JAMES A. GAGE, Professor of Industrial and Operations Engineering,
Retirement retired from  active faculty status as of June 30, 1975, as a teacher and
Graduate and Undergraduate Program Advisor.
A native of Michigan, Professor Gage received a B.S. in Applied Science
from Michigan State University. He received his Bachelor's and Master's
degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin in 1948.
He served from 1936 to 1942 as production control supervisor in industry.
He served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945 as Lieutenant
(Sr.Gr.) in the Pacific Theater of Operation. He was awarded two bronze
stars; one for meritorious service and the other for heroic achievement.
In 1949, Professor Gage started teaching at the University of Wisconsin
as an Assistant Professor until 1952 when he was promoted to Associate
Professor. He remained at the University of Wisconsin until 1956 when he
came to The University of Michigan. From 1958 to 1960, Professor Gage was
on leave at Waseda University of Tokyo to work with the ICA-Waseda Institute where he served as chief resident advisor. He was instrumental in
establishing a program at the undergraduate and graduate levels while there.
Upon his return to The University of Michigan he was promoted to Professor
of Industrial Engineering.
During the time he was in Tokyo at the Waseda Institute for Research
in Productivity, he studied Japanese manufacturing and management methods
and started programs on an experimental basis through the Institute to
strengthen the inter-relationship between Japanese industry and academic
research. He also studied production management methods in Japan, particularly those procedures enabling the Japanese to compete successfully in
this country, and the "life-job" tradition of Japanese industry.
Upon his return from Japan in 1960, he participated in the development
of general standard data for the MTM Association. He also worked with the
Bureau of Hospital Administration during 1964 and 1965.
His administrative capabilities as Undergraduate Program Advisor and
later as Advisor for both the Undergraduate and Graduate Programs over
the past nine years were valuable to the department in assimilating the rapid
growth in student enrollment during this period.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator for his dedicated
service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Industrial and Operations
Engineering.

His consultative efforts have been extremely helpful to all of the clinical
divisions of the University of Michigan Medical Center, to the local practitioners in the area and many cases have been referred to him from the state
of Michigan and from elsewhere in the country. His work in neoplasms of
the head and neck has been particularly outstanding. Cure rates due to




16


JULY MEETING, 1975


radiation therapy in the University Hospital have consistently improved
over the years under his guidance. This has been particularly true in the
field of neoplasms of the female pelvis.
In addition, generations of medical students from 1934 to 1974 have
benefited from the wisdom of his teaching and have achieved a broader
understanding of the many types of neoplasm and their importance in
clinical medicine. He has had close relationships with the heads of Medicine,
Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Otorhinolaryngology and Hematology
in collaborative efforts for caring of patients with cancer. Dr. Lampe is a
member of Alpha Omega Alpha, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi and the outstanding radiologic organizations in the country. He has contributed significantly to the medical literature with over 100 publications and has given
numerous honorary lectures throughout the country. Among the most recent
of his accomplishments are the adaptation of modern statistical methods of
cancer followup files. His grateful patients are from the University community
as well as elsewhere in the state and nation.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator and researcher
for his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Radiology.
F. E. Legg, Jr.   FRANK EVARISTE LEGG, JR., Associate Professor of Construction
Retirement Materials, has retired from active faculty status as of June 30, 1975. He was
one of the country's most outstanding teachers and researchers in the field
of highway aggregates. His efforts through the years have helped produce
better highways and better civil engineers.
Professor Legg was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He took his undergraduate and graduate studies at The University of Michigan where he
received his A.B. in 1933 and his M.S. in physics in 1934. Following graduation, he accepted a position with the Michigan State Highway Department
Testing Laboratory on The University of Michigan campus. During the years

played a major role in the teaching of virus laboratory methods both in
the classroom and as advisor to graduate students on their doctoral dissertations. She exemplified those important characteristics of the good teacher:
patience and a desire to share information with others. She wrote large
segments of a manual developed for student use in this laboratory, and was
co-author of a chapter in the standard reference Diagnostic Procedures for
Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, published by the American Public Health
Association.
During her career, Professor Minuse played a significant role in research
on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of influenza infections. Her experience
with influenza viruses is legendary, and for the past two decades the characterization of influenza strains, which she performed, set the standard
nationally and internationally.
The Regents now salute this capable scientist for a lifetime of dedication
to research and teaching by naming her Associate Professor Emeritus of
Epidemiology.
ROGER A. PACK, Professor of Greek and Latin, has retired from active  R. A. Pack
faculty status as of May 31, 1975, after a distinguished career as a teacher  Retirement
and scholar.
Roger Pack received his A.B. degree from The University of Michigan
in 1929 and the Ph.D. degree also from this University in 1934. He began
his professional career with instructorships at the University of Missouri and
Ohio State University in 1936-37 and 1937-38 respectively. He then came
to The University of Michigan in the fall of 1938 and has remained here
from that time, rising through the ranks until his appointment to full
Professor of Greek and Latin in 1965. His service here was interrupted only
by a period of service to his country in World War II in Military Counter
Intelligence.
Professor Pack's greatest service to the Department has been his
teaching of graduate courses and seminars, particularly in the Latin field,
which is his specialty. In courses at this level, his great learning, his patience
with students, and his meticulously precise scholarship have combined to
make him invaluable and irreplaceable.
The accuracy and general high quality of Professor Pack's research is
recognized both in this country and abroad. He was one of the few American
scholars asked to contribute to the Oxford Classical Dictionary and the
Reallexikon fur Antike und Christentum. His Greek and Latin Literary Texts
from Graeco-Roman Egypt is the standard repertory in this field, and is so
accepted and known that he is referred to often in European bibliographies
simply as "P."
Professor Pack has contributed substantially to the training and development of many outstanding young classicists who have attended his classes,
to the body of scholarly works in libraries all over the world, and thus to
the respected position of leadership this University entertains among the
world's scholarly institutions.

for such purpose, to pay the installments of the principal and interest on the
Note as they fall due.

JULY MEETING, 1975


Boioloicl tatin  Regent Brown moved that the recommendation to award the
Contract Awarded construction contract for the dining hall at the Biological Station
to Concrete Systems, Inc., of Cheboygan, Michigan be approved.
Regent Laro seconded the motion and it was adopted.
roects Approved  On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont, Regent Nederlander moved that approval be given to proceed with three construction projects: an electrical substation at Willow Run Airport,
roof repairs at the Rackham Building, and completion of the stack
area at Bentley Historical Library. Regent Laro seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
1975-76 Budget  President Fleming then stated that it was impossible to adopt
a final budget at this time since no action has been taken in
Lansing on the 1975-76 appropriation bill. It is felt, however, that
the final bill will be within 1 per cent of the figures outlined in
the document. It would be helpful if the key decisions regarding
tuition increase and salary schedule could be made at this time,
so that the final budget would be brought to the Regents in September with minor corrections. The Flint and Dearborn budgets
have been prepared along the same principles as the Ann Arbor
budget, with only slight variations.
The President also said there is widespread feeling that if
revenues do not equal expenditures an executive order for cutbacks
may follow the adoption of the budget. Should this occur, it might
be necessary to take steps to freeze funds this fall so that the
University can comply with the executive order.
Vice-President Pierpont explained the details of the budget
document and said that funds for student aid will be increased
proportionately so that available funds will equal the current
year's.
Tuition Increase  Vice-President Rhodes indicated that the tuition increase
would create hardships on students, but that a 6 per cent increase
was the most modest they could recommend in light of present
conditions.
Chancellor Moran reported that full-time student fees at the
Flint campus will be increased by 8.1 per cent, while at the same
time there will be a reduction in credit hour fees to ease the hardship on part-time students.
Chancellor Goodall indicated that tuition at Dearborn will
be increased by 6 per cent.
Regent Baker stated that he was grateful to the faculty and
the administrative units for their cost-cutting efforts in these
austere times.




JULY MEETING, 1975


33


Regent Dunn moved that the tuition increase and the tentative
1975-76 budget for all three campuses be approved as outlined,
placing the last document on the agenda for final confirmation at
the September meeting. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion
and it was adopted.
Regent Laro moved that the rent increases for University
family housing be approved, as recommended by Vice-President
Johnson. Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Roach commended the Executive Officers for good
management in permitting the tuition increase to be kept to a
minimum. But he noted that the total cost of room, board, and
tuition for resident students would be only about 2 per cent
higher than last year, a very low increase in view of the rate of
inflation.
Regent Laro stated that the Regents are greatly aware of
the hardships to students caused by an increase, but felt that
everything had been done to keep the increase as low as possible.
Regent Baker moved that Chancellor Goodall be authorized
to use the design/build method and the competitive bidding
procedure for the UM-Dearborn parking structure. Regent
Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The report on Temporary Investments was received.
On recommendation of Vice-President Pierpont, the Regents
authorized the purchase of property at 436 Thompson Street, Ann
Arbor.
The Regents authorized the acceptance of a cash discount
offer on the payoff of a land contract on property at 807 Holly
Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota, as recommended by Vice-President
Pierpont.
Regent Laro moved that the 1975-76 Hospital budget be
approved as documented. Regent Nederlander seconded the motion,
and it was adopted.
In this connection, Regent Roach inquired about the professional fee increases.
Acting Director David Dickinson responded that historically,
these fees have been low in relation to market rates. This increase
would bring the professional fees more in line with others.
Regent Dunn stated that the charges for intensive care units
were very high.
Dr. Dickinson said units such as the Holden and Burn units
were very expensive, but were highly specialized and superior to
others of its kind.

Dickinson's service to the University during the past year in his
capacity as Acting Director of University Hospital. Dr. Dickinson
has served with care and commitment in an area of great importance to this University-City community, and to the State and
nation as well.

The Regents authorized Vice-President Rhodes to negotiate
with the candidates who have been recommended for the position
of Dean of the School of Natural Resources.
XI. OTHER
A report was received on cost-cutting in the residence halls
and accessibility of budget documents in the Housing Division.
In connection with the request for membership in the Michigan
Energy and Resource Research Association (MERRA), Regent
Nederlander asked what benefits would be derived from this membership.
Vice-President Overberger responded that the benefits would
come from interaction with the Association more than from formal
meetings.
Regent Nederlander said that he would like a report of the
following: an analysis of the budget-how the money is to be
spent and the duplications, if any, of our own services.
Regent Dunn moved that this item be brought to the Regents

in September along with a response to the questions raised. Regent
Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
A report of the visiting committee of the Medical Center     Medical Center

Chancellor Moran then stated that the physical site alterations  Flint Physical
Site Alterations
at the Flint campus needed to be reviewed by the Regents.       Site Alterations
He said the carpenters' strike has cost a two-month delay.
Therefore, the Classroom-Office Building may not be ready for
the fall term; 1976.
Mr. Robert Wilson, Assistant to the Chancellor, made a Flint Development
Plans
presentation of short-range development plans for the Flint campus.
In connection with the parking lot construction, Regent Nederlander stated that paving is too expensive if it is to be torn up
in a few years and replaced by a structure. Therefore, he would
like an analysis of the parking problem brought to the next
Regents' meeting.
Regent Brown moved that the following resolution of the Board  Title IX
r                                ~ 5   1,              Resolution
of Regents be approved:
Recent public debate concerning Title IX of the Education Amendment
of 1972 has focused the attention of many citizens on its impact upon educational and athletic opportunities.
The Board of Regents hereby reaffirms its position that women are
entitled to equal opportunity in all areas of endeavor in the University including admissions, scholarships, counselling, employment, and athletics.
The Regents recognize the financial implications of supporting women's
intercollegiate athletic teams and support the passage of rules at the forthcoming NCAA convention which will effect cost reductions in intercollegiate
athletics.
The Regents reaffirm their commitment to excellence in athletic programs
for both men and women.
Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote unless otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents for June 1975 totaled $409.77.
The Regents adjourned to meet on September 18 and 19.

Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of Ronald 0.
Lippitt. The following memoir was adopted:
R. 0. Lippitt,   RONALD 0. LIPPITT, Professor of Sociology and Psychology, has
Retirement retired from active faculty status as of June 30, 1974, after a most productive
career as a teacher and researcher.
A native of Minnesota, Professor Lippitt took undergraduate studies at
Springfield College (including a year at Rousseau Institute, University of
Geneva, on a Foreign Study Scholarship) before entering the State University of Iowa where he received his Ph.D. in 1940.
From 1941 through 1944, Professor Lippitt was Assistant Director of
Research and Statistical Services with the Boy Scouts of America in New
York City. In 1945, he joined the U.S. Public Health Service as a commissioned officer before going to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
where he helped to create the Research Center for Group Dynamics.
Dr. Lippitt was co-inventor of the T-group (sensitivity group) in 1946
and co-founded the National Training Laboratories. In 1948, the Research
Center for Group Dynamics moved to the Institute for Social Research on
The University of Michigan campus where Dr. Lippitt became a Program
Director and Associate Professor in Sociology and Psychology. He was
promoted to Professor in 1952. He received an honorary doctorate from
Springfield College in 1962 and one from Leslie College in 1965.
Dr. Lippitt was one of the innovators in the development of experimental
social psychology; his research on autocracy and democracy is a classic in
the field of social psychology. He also initiated research on delinquency with
the Fliint Youth Studies, the social structure of elementary school classrooms
in Grand Rapids, and street work with delinquent gangs in collaboration
with the Chicago Boys Club. He is heavily involved in what was initially
the National Training Laboratories in Group Development in Bethel, Maine,
which became the National Training Labs in Washington, D.C. He was cofounder of the Center for Research on Utilization of Scientific Knowledge
which originated in the Institute for Social Research in 1964. There he worked
on research in problem solving to improve classroom learning, retrieving

social science knowledge for secondary curriculum development, and many
other studies-mostly dealing with young people (i.e., the Cross Age Helping
Package, where older children teach younger children). His hundred-plus
publications are known throughout the world.
In his role as professor, Dr. Lippitt created a three-semester laboratory
practicum in change agentry for advanced graduate students in a dozen
professional schools and departments of The University of Michigan. He has
served as a consultant to educational and planned change innovators throughout the United States as well as abroad.
The Regents happily salute Professor Lippitt on the occasion of his
retirement and are pleased to name him Professor Emeritus of Psychology.
VII. DEATHS
No deaths were reported.

Vice-President Kennedy then stated that the recommendation  Hospitalt  nedorsement of Onefrom the Hospital Director and Executive Board endorses the Time Replacement
concept of replacing the obsolete portions of University Hospital  f Portions
in a single project rather than in phases.
This planning approach is related to the apparent intention
of the Michigan legislature to adopt a resolution which would
place the question of a $140 million bond issue for hospital replacement before the voters in November 1976.
Recommendations as to the size or type of project, the number
of elements involved or the location will be discussed by the
Hospital Board and, the Regents at future meetings.
Regent Roach moved that the Hospital Board's recommendation to proceed with further examination of the one-time approach
to replacing portions of University Hospital be approved. Regent
Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.

HONORARY DEGREES
Characterizations by Harvey Jacobson, James Frenza
and Gilbert Goodwin
Conferred August 17, 1975
MARY ELLEN AVERY, Thomas Morgan Rotch Professor of Pediatrics, Harvard University, and Physician-in-Chief at the Children's Hospital Medical Center, Boston.
Your leadership in medicine and education has earned widespread
appreciation and admiration. You are one of the few women to have risen
to such a peak of prominence in your profession, and this distinction serves
to enhance your record of accomplishment.
A sensitive and assiduous scientist, you have conducted critical investigations of respiratory distress in the youngest of infants. Your detailed
research has enabled you and scores of your students to make substantial
contributions to the well-being of the newborn.
The people who have trained with you hold you in esteem as an inspiring teacher. Your contributions to the scientific press have been numerous and significant. Amid teaching, research, and administrative duties, you
have found time to give of yourself to important service in both the public
and private sectors.
The University of Michigan is proud to have you share this day with
us and to confer upon you the degree Doctor of Science.
RALPH BELKNAP BALDWIN, Bachelor of Science, 1934; Master
of Science, 1935; Doctor of Philosophy, 1937; astronomer, physicist, and
manufacturing executive.
Your achievements in such disparate fields as lunar astronomy, research
physics, and the manufacture of commercial machinery are truly remarkable.
Your contributions in any one of these areas would distinguish a life's work.
As an astronomer, your pioneering studies of the moon have expanded
our horizons. The Face of the Moon and its sequels are so scrupulous and
thorough that they are required reading for all serious students of our
satellite planet. When men landed on the lunar surface, they confirmed
what you had already told us of its physical features.
This nation and its Allies were beneficiaries of your talents as scientist
during World War II. As a senior physicist for the project which produced
the radio proximity fuse for anti-aircraft and anti-personnel use, you were
instrumental in the development of a major weapon which allowed the
United States fleet to operate in Japanese waters and which helped save
London and other cities from rocket attacks.
Your postwar efforts in the development of the wood-processing equipment industry have earned you national and international acclaim in yet
a third career.
The University of Michigan is proud to recognize the many attainments of its distinguished alumnus and confers upon you the honorary
degree Doctor of Laws.

investment transactions, plant extension, litigation and personnellabor relations. He also filed a quarterly report on purchases and
payment transactions over $1,000 from single sources.
In connection with the plant extension report, Regent Roach
questioned the costly renovations item for the Barbour-Newberry
residence halls. He said that the buildings are old and would have
to be replaced in the near future; therefore it might be wise to
consider replacement rather than renovations.
Vice-President Pierpont responded that this has been discussed,
but that it was determined replacement would not be necessary
for ten to fifteen years.
Regent Roach stated that in order to avoid major renovation
costs, planning of how to replace these buildings should begin now.
Regent Roach commented that the quarterly report on purchases over $1,000 was comprehensive and long. He asked if, in
the interest of cost-cutting, it would be feasible to omit the sections
on standardization program  transactions and transactions per
government or educational price agreements.
Regent Dunn responded that these particular sections have
been included in the report because of a directive by the Auditor
General. Therefore, if these sections are deleted, it is highly
possible that they would have to be added later.
Regent Baker commented that xeroxing is a significant expense
and felt that an attempt should be made to reduce these costs.
Vice-President Pierpont responded that the University is aware
of these expenses and is trying to keep them under control through.
the use of copy centers.
Regent Roach then asked Vice-President Pierpont to look into
the Auditor General's comment in order to determine the feasibility of reducing the amount, and thus the cost, of paperwork in
this report.
Regent Nederlander inquired about the work study agreements
for legal aid services.
Vice-President Pierpont responded that these programs were
financed by grants from the Federal Government and were University-wide.in scope. Mr. Pierpont said that he would look into
those programs involving legal aid.
Vice-President Overberger filed a listing of grants and contracts
for research and a report on research expenditures during fiscal

Legislative
Authorization
for Construction
Contracts Report
UM-Dearborn
Parking Structure
Contract Awarded


The Regents received a report of the University's position
relative to a request for legislative authorization before letting
construction contracts for any University project financed by selfliquidating, gift, grant, or institutional funds.
On recommendation of Chancellor Goodall, Regent Nederlander moved that the low bidder, H. F. Campbell Company, be
awarded the contract for the construction of the UM-Dearborn
parking structure, and authorized a bank loan to finance the
project. Regent Brown seconded the motion. Regents Baker and
Laro then stated that they would abstain from the vote because
of a possible conflict of interest.
President Fleming then explained that a two-thirds affirmative
vote was necessary for approval. Since Regent Power was out of
the country and the bidding time would lapse before the next
Regents' meeting, her vote would be obtained by telephone and
later confirmed by a formal written statement.
The vote was taken: there were five affirmative votes and two
abstentions. The President then asked Secretary Kennedy to con

tact Regent Power. (Regent Power was contacted by telephone
later in the day and voted for the letting of the contract and loan
agreement.) Both the resolution and the loan agreement appear
as Appendix B to these minutes.
Vice-President Rhodes commented on the State appropriations    Budget Request,
request for 1976-77. He said the detailed forms had to be sub-    1976-77
mitted by November 1. He was, therefore, asking for approval
of the provisional request components and would bring the budget
requests for 1976-77 back to the Regents after the hearing in
Lansing.
Regent Dunn then moved that the following request for provisional amounts for State Appropriations for 1976-77 be approved. These components are for the Ann Arbor campus including
the Mental Health Units. It was understood that requests for the
Dearborn and Flint campuses also would be submitted based on
the same assumption used for the Ann Arbor request.

Regent Waters seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Baker commented that he hoped the Legislature would
give this request serious consideration for, if the University is
not adequately funded, we cannot meet the goal of superior education set for us by the State of Michigan.
Vice-President Rhodes then commented on the Fall Term          Enrollment
1975 enrollment statistics. He said that the increase in enrollment  Statistics
seemed to be a nationwide phenomena this year and could be
attributed to returning students who, for various reasons, were
delaying their entry into the job market. The resulting increase
in revenue, however helpful this year, could not be guaranteed in
the future, perhaps not even beyond this Fall term.

The convention shall consist of thirteen at-large degelates from
the student body, twenty-seven student government delegates, and
general delegates, not to exceed a grand total of 75 delegates.
Elections of at-large delegates shall be held concurrently with
the Fall 1975 SGC elections. Student government delegates
shall be appointed by the various student governments. General
delegates shall be seated upon presentation of a petition signed
by fifty or more currently enrolled students. All delegates shall
be currently enrolled students. The complete text of the Constitutional Convention Plan is on file in the Secretary's office.
Vice-President Johnson stated there should be some assurance
of minority representation.
Regent Roach then stated that SGC should take positive steps
to encourage minorities and women to seek positions as delegates.
Regent Baker noted that the voter turnout for this type of
election has been poor in recent years. Further, if the student body
does not perceive the delegates to the convention as properly and
fairly elected, the whole convention process would be discredited.
Mr. David responded that they will make every effort to have
a good voter turnout.
Regent Roach then moved that Student Government Council
call a constitutional convention, as provided in their constitution,
for the purposes of reorganizing the central student government.
Regent Baker seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The remaining sections of the report-student participation in
decision making and student governance system-will be referred
to the Regents at their November meeting.
The procedures for appointment of Medical/Dental Staff were
received by the Regents.
Regent Roach commented he was pleased that the Hospital
Medical staff and the Executive Committtee took adequate meas

ures to review the qualifications of the recommended staff appointments.
After review, the Regents adopted the procedure for revising  Bylaw Revision
the Regents' Bylaws as amended.                             Adopted
The Regents received a preliminary annual report on the Washtenaw County
Legal Aid Society
Washtenaw County Legal Aid Society-Campus Branch.           — Campus Branch
In this connection, Regent Baker asked if the Legal Aid Society
had clients other than University students.
Mr. Jonathan Rose, attorney for the Society, stated their
clientele were primarily University students and a very few lowincome University staff people.
Regent Laro inquired as to the usual disposition of the landlord cases.
Mr. Rose responded that the majority of cases were settled
out of court and involve maintenance or deposit problems.
President Fleming concluded that this service has been very
valuable.
Vice-President Johnson then stated that a proposal for the
continuation of this service would be brought to the Regents in
December.
The Regents received a demolition schedule for structures on
the University of Michigan-Flint riverfront campus development site.
A long discussion concerning dissatisfaction with the current PIRGIM
PIRGIM fee collection system was held during the Public Comments session on Thursday. This discussion resulted in a request
for the revision of the current system.
Regent Baker stated that the following student governments
and organizations had passed resolutions indicating dissatisfaction
with the current system: SGC, LSA, Engineering, Business, Law,
Dentistry, Pharmacy, Mortarboard, Vulcans, Fraternity Coordinating Council, and Panhellenic Association. Further, he had
been asked by student representatives to present the following
motion. Therefore, he moved that the current method of PIRGIM
funding be revised beginning in the Fall Term 1976 so that an
assessment choice form and PIRGIM information sheet be included with the first tuition bill of each term. At that time each
student may accept or reject the $1.50 semester assessment charge
which is paid to the PIRGIM organization. Those students who
desired to support PIRGIM would return the executed form to
the University. Regent Laro seconded the motion. The motion
failed.

Regent Roach then moved that PIRGIM be given notice of
termination of the present contract and that the Executive Officers
solicit comments and recommendations for changes or continuation
before the January meeting. Regent Nederlander seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
Regent Baker asked Regent Roach to amend his motion so
that immediate consultation begin with instruction to the Executive
Officers to make available at the January meeting one or more
proposals for the fee collection procedure. Regent Roach so agreed.
On recommendation of Chancellor Goodall, Regent Baker
moved that the firm of Harley Ellington Pierce Yee Associates
be proposed to the State Joint Capital Outlay Sub-Committee as
architects for the Plant Operations Building at UM-Dearborn.
Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
On recommendation of Chancellor Moran, Regent Roach
moved that the firm of Smith, Hinchman & Grylls be recommended to the State Bureau of Facilities to provide architectural
services and programming assistance for the Classroom-Laboratory
Building at UM-Flint. Regent Brown seconded the motion and
it was adopted, with Regent Baker abstaining.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote unless otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents reported for the month of September 1975 totaled $881.66.
The Regents adjourned to meet on November 20 and 21.

WHEREAS, The Regents of The University of Michigan in the exercise
of its constitutional duties has determined that it is necessary and expedient
to enlarge and improve its parking facilities at the Dearborn Campus, by
the construction of a parking structure to be located on Monteith Boulevard
near Fair Lane Street, to accommodate 800 automobiles; by the construction
of an additional surface parking lot to be located on Richard Drive to accommodate 462 automobiles; and by the improvement of an existing surface
parking lot located on Richard Drive which accommodates 497 automobiles;
at an estimated cost of $1,600,000.00 exclusive of funds already available
to the University.
WHEREAS, in the opinion of said Regents it is necessary and expedient
that it borrow by means of a commercial bank loan the sum of $1,600,000.00,
to be used by it, together with other funds available, in paying off the cost
of such parking facilities; and
WHEREAS, there has been submitted for consideration of this Board
a proposed Term Loan and Security Agreement whereby the sum of
$1,600,000.00 may be borrowed from the Detroit Bank and Trust Company
for a term of approximately 9 years starting November 1, 1975;
Now, THEREFORE, Be It Resolved that The Regents of The University
of Michigan borrow for such purposes the sum of $1,600,000.000 from the

Agreement, hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement." Said loan is to be
for a term of approximately 9 years, starting November 1, 1975, at an interest
rate of 634 percent per annum. The repayment of this loan is to be secured
by a pledge of the Net Income derived from the operation of all incomeproducing parking facilities of the University at the Dearborn Campus, as
defined in the Agreemeent. In the event said Net Income is not sufficient to
repay said loan, the same will be paid, to the extent necessary, from other
funds of the University legally available therefor, as defined in the Agreement; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the University covenants and agrees
that, commencing with the Fiscal Year beginning July 1, 1975, it will establish and maintain parking fees and charges sufficient in amount so that the

Agreement, for each year pledged, shall be substantially sufficient to pay the
installments of principal and interest on the Promissory Note evidencing said
loan as they fall due; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the interest and principal payments
accruing during the term shall be paid from the Net Income of the University's Parking System, as defined in the Agreement, and, in the event said
Net Income is not sufficient to repay said loan, the same will be paid, to the
extent necessary, from other funds of the University as may be legally
available therefor; provided, however, the University reserves the right to
prepay the Note in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the
Agreement; and

but no such amendment shall change the provisions therein for the amount
to be borrowed, the interest to be paid thereon, the payments required to

change the date of issue of said Note, the date of payment of interest, or the
dates fixed for payments in the said Agreement; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the said officers, in the execution of said
Agreement and Note, shall not pledge the credit of or create any liability on
the part of the State of Michigan, The Regents of The University of Michigan, or any member or officer of this Board, or any of their successors, other

available therefor as herein provided; and said Agreement and Note are not
intended to create any indebtedness of the State of Michigan or The Regents
of The University of Michigan within the meaning of any State constitutional
debt limitation or restriction; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that should it develop that Wilbur K. Pierpont,
Vice-President of The Regents of The University of Michigan, through illness, absence, or otherwise, be unable to perform the acts he is herein
authorized, empowered, and directed to perform, then in that case, Richard
L. Kennedy, Secretary of The Regents of The University of Michigan, is
hereby authorized, empowered and directed to perform any and all acts and
deeds herein authorized and directed to be performed by said Wilbur K.
Pierpont, and any action so taken by said Richard L. Kennedy shall be as
binding on The Regents of The University of Michigan as if performed by

deeds herein authorized and directed to be performed by the said Richard
L. Kennedy, and any action so taken by said Chandler W. Matthews shall
be as binding on The Regents of The University of Michigan as if performed
by the said Richard L. Kennedy.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the said officers are authorized, if they
so desire, to sign said Term Loan and Security Agreement and Note as
W. K. Pierpont, R. L. Kennedy, or C. W. Matthews, respectively.

expense of operation), administration costs (consistent with heretofore
established accounting procedures), maintenance and repairs of the Parking
System and renovation and replacement of the equipment used in connection

that may be legally used by the University to pay principal of and interest
on the Note but shall not include any funds (a) specifically pledged for other
present or future loans to the extent so pledged, or (b) the use of which

FUNDS LEGALLY AVAILABLE THEREFOR
The University covenants and agrees that it will from time to time
allocate out of the collections of Net Income amounts fully sufficient, when

such purpose, to pay the installments of the principal and interest on the
Note as they fall due.

from the Net Income to such other lawful purposes of the University as are
consistent with the requirements of Section 14 of this Agreement.

virtue of any statute or otherwise, it being hereby expressly agreed that no
personal liability shall attach to, or be incurred by, the said officers or any

reason of any or either of the obligations, covenants, stipulations, or agreements herein incurred, or in the Note, expressed or contained therein, or
implied therefrom, it being expressly understood and agreed that this loan

its or their successors, all other liability, except as herein provided, being
expressly waived. Said Note and this Agreement are not intended to create
any indebtedness of the State of Michigan or The Regents of The University
of Michigan within the meaning of any State constitutional debt limitation
or restriction.
SECTION 11
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
The University represents and warrants that:
a. No litigation or governmental proceedings are pending, or, to the

c. No indebtedness, obligation, pledge of Net Income, lien or other
charge exists against the Parking System or the Net Income other than current obligations for operation and maintenance of the Parking System and
the obligations for engineering, construction, improvement and other costs
of the additional parking structure and the present and additional surface
lots.

If any one or more of the following events herein called "Events of
Default," shall occur and be continuing, the principal amount of the Note
and accrued unpaid interest thereon shall become due and payable upon
demand:

or of the date of such report, statement, schedule or certificate.
SECTION 13
REMEDY ON DEFAULT
In case of any Event of Default, the Bank may proceed to enforce its
rights either by mandamus or other remedy provided by law, to compel the
University to perform each and every covenant herein contained, or by injunction, or other remedy provided by law, to prevent the University from
performing any act in violation of said covenants.
The University expressly authorizes the Bank to bring any of the actions
at law or in equity hereinbefore mentioned, and hereby waives any immunity
to be proceeded against as herein authorized, which may exist by reason of
it being a subdivision of State Government.

COVENANTS OF THE UNIVERSITY WITH
RESPECT TO INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Loan Agreement or
any resolution adopted heretofore, the University hereby covenants and
agrees that it will not invest or reinvest the proceeds of the loan in a manner

amended, and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(b) The University further covenants that it will not cause at any time

to be used directly or indirectly in a manner which would result in the
exclusion of said Note from the treatment afforded by Section 103(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, by reason of the classification of such Note as "an industrial development bond" within the meaning
of Section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and all
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(c) The Univsersity shall keep full and complete records of all deposits
to and withdrawals from each of the funds and accounts related to the

therefrom.
SECTION 15

155


Trust Company, 211 West Fort Street, Detroit, Michigan, respectively, or if
any other address shall at any time be designated by either in writing to the
other, to such other address.
(b) No course of dealing between the University and the Bank or any
delay on the part of the Bank in exercising any rights hereunder or under
the Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights hereunder or under the
Note or otherwise.
(c) If and when the principal of and interest on the Note shall have
been paid in full, then this Agreement shall be terminated and shall be of
no further force and effect, and upon request of the University, the Bank
shall execute an instrument specifically releasing the University from the
agreements and covenants herein.
(d) Should any provision, sentence, or section of this Loan Agreement

counterparts, together, shall and will constitute one and the same instrument.

Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of George G.
Cameron, Professor of Near Eastern Studies, and Walter S. Wilde,
Professor of Physiology. The following memoirs were adopted:
G. C. Cameron     With retirement this year, Professor GEORGE G. CAMERON formally
Retirement closed a distinguished scholarly and teaching career of some forty-two years,
the last twenty-seven of which have been spent at The University of Michigan. Obtaining his Ph.D. as an Assyriologist from the Oriental Institute of
the University of Chicago in 1932, Cameron taught Assyro-Babylonian cuneiform and related studies at the Institute until 1948, when he left to become
Professor and Chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Studies at the
University. While at Chicago, Professor Cameron especially devoted himself
to the then nascent study of Elamite, the earliest language of Iran, and to
the more classical Old Persian. In both of these, he holds a place within the
very small group of foremost Iranists in the world.
A lively classroom teacher of undergraduates and graduates, as well as
an outstanding scholar, Professor Cameron gradually built his Department
from its investigations in the major ancient and modern Near Eastern
languages, literatures, and histories. His efforts brought Michigan into the
forefront of Near Eastern studies both nationally and internationally, where
it stands today. Cameron has participated in many expeditions and explorations in the Near East, most dramatically in 1947, when his obtaining a latex
squeeze of part of Darius' Inscription at Behistun brought him world-wide
acclaim. He is the author of many books, articles and reviews, as well as the
editor of texts in Assyro-Babylonian cuneiform and in Elamite and Old
Persian. He is also a former editor of the Journal of Near Eastern Studies.
The Regents happily salute Professor Cameron on the occasion of his
retirement and are pleased to name him Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern
Studies.
W. S. Wilde     WALTER S. WILDE, Professor of Physiology, has retired from active
Retirement faculty status as of May 31, 1975, after serving as teacher and researcher
for nineteen years with the Univsrsity.
Professor Wilde was born in Toronto, Canada, and became a naturalized
citizen of the United States at the age of seven. He completed his undergraduate studies at Miami University of Ohio before entering graduate school
at the University of Minnesota. He received his M.A. in 1933 and Ph.D. in
1937.
From 1937 Professor Wilde held junior teaching and research appointments at the University of Wyoming and Louisiana State University, School
of Medicine. He was appointed Assistant Professor at Louisiana State University in 1943. From 1945 to 1947 he held senior research appointments with the
Carnegie Institution of Washington and the National Institutes of Health
in Bethesda, Maryland.




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1975


163


Tulane University School of Medicine granted him an Associate Professorship in 1947 and promoted him to full Professor in Physiology in 1956.
In 1956, Professor Wilde joined the University of Michigan Medical
School as full Professor. He contributed his knowledge to both instructional
and research programs of the Department of Physiology of the Medical
School during his nineteen years with the University.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his
dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Physiology.

A report on the status of the North Campus Incinerator was

excellent cooperation of all members of the University community
in this difficult task. He also stated that further reductions would
be necessary if the pending executive order from the Governor
was finalized.

Vice-President Pierpont responded that studies of other programs had been made at various times which indicated that the
Blue Cross-Blue Shield coverage was the best.
Regent Waters asked if this increase had been budgeted for
those under contract.
Vice-President Pierpont stated that it had not, but that it
would be the first charge against next year's contract.
Regent Laro suggested that it might be advantageous at this
time to look into the insurance programs of private carriers.
Regent Nederlander then moved that the recommendation that
the University payment for health insurance be increased to $47.00
per month, effective December 1, 1975, be approved. Regent
Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Vice-President Pierpont explained that the recommendation for
an increase in the staff paid parking fee was based upon the need
for additional revenue to cover the substantial increase in maintenance costs of the University parking structures, and for continuing improvements in the total parking system.
Regent Brown then moved that the staff paid parking permit
fee be increased to $50.00 per year, effective September 1, 1976,
and that all other parking fees be increased appropriately at that
time. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The Regents took formal action to accept the pledge of the
Herbert H. and Grace A. Dow Foundation of $4 million and that
of the Harry A. and Margaret D. Towsley Foundation of $1.5
million, both designated for a new building to house the Departments of Chemical and Materials and Metallurgical Engineering
on the North Campus; to name the facility in honor of Herbert
Henry Dow, founder of the Dow Chemical Company; and to
recommend to the State the firm of Alden B. Dow Associates, Inc.,
of Midland, Michigan, as architects for the new facility.


Research  Vice-President Overberger reported that in order to continue
Laboratories
Renovation the study of DNA techniques, it would be necessary to renovate
some research laboratories. He said that a committee had been
formed to study the social and ethical implications of this work,
and its conclusion was that no "high risk" research would be
undertaken that is contrary to social and public policy.
Regent Dunn moved that the recommendation for the renovation of three research laboratory complexes as "Moderate Risk
Containment Facilities" which would permit continuation and
expansion of ongoing faculty work with recombinant DNA techniques or oncogenic viruses, be approved. Regent Brown seconded
the motion and it was adopted.




NOVEMBER MEETING, 1975

Vice-President Pierpont discussed the need for expansion of
the Transportation Services facility.
Regent Roach then moved that authorization be given to the
University to proceed with the expansion of the Transportation

The Regents approved the construction projects for fire pro- ISMRRD
tection at the Institute for the Study of Mental Retardation and
Related Disabilities (ISMRRD), and for the improvement of
boiler water treatment equipment at the Central Heating Plant.
Vice-President Pierpont reported on the status of the property Real Property
at 2947-2953 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, and that the lessee of the
building has filed for bankruptcy. The Regents authorized VicePresident Pierpont to obtain an appraisal of the property and
proceed to contact possible purchasers and/or brokers, looking to
the sale of the property.


The report on Temporary Investments was received.
Regent Roach moved that the existing recommendation to the
State for an architect for the Medical Library Building, which
was adopted at the September Regents' meeting, be withdrawn,
and that the firm of Jickling and Lyman be recommended to the
State as the architect for this facility. The motion was seconded
by Regent Waters and adopted.

Dentistry on the occasion of its centennial year. Established by Regental
action in 1875, it was the second University Dental School founded in
the nation, and is the oldest of any state university. It has from its
earliest days provided outstanding leadership in educational and professional fields. In the recent survey of professional school rankings by
Blau and Margolis, for example, the University of Michigan School ot
Dentistry was ranked number one in the nation.
The Regents applaud the leadership that the University of Michigan
Dental School and its alumni have provided in dental education, research,
professional practice and continuing public service and extend their
commendations, congratulations and good wishes as it enters its second
century.
Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
CSSG      A discussion of two resolutions resulting from   the report on
the Commission to Study Student Governance concerning student
participation and academic decision-making, and student representation at Regens' meetings, took place during the Public Comments Session on Thursday.
Student    Since these resolutions were rejected by the students, Regent
Resolution Nederlander introduced and moved that the following resolution
on student participation in department, school or college governance be approved:
The report of the Student Governance Commission has now been before
the Regents for some time. Its recommendations have been supported by the
students and rejected by the faculty. The efforts of the Executive Officers
to find a middle way have been rejected by the students.
The Regents believe that whether or not student participation will work
depends on the willingness of the groups who are involved to accept it.
In this context, it would be inappropriate for the Regents to direct the
faculty to discuss with the students their participation in any and all decision
making within the departments, the schools, and the colleges.
On the other hand, the Regents believe that discussions between student
government groups and the faculties of the various colleges and schools on
the subject of student participation would be worthwhile. The Regents make
no pronouncement as to the kinds and degrees of participation, because if it
is to work at all, it will work only through acceptance and cooperation.
In short, the Regents are unwilling at this point in time to mandate
the faculties to come to an agreement with students on participation in
department, school or college governance. The Regents feel there is wisdom
in discussions of the matter of student participation between the various
student governments and the faculties wih a view towards experimenting
with such areas as they are able to agree upon. If these agreements then
require Regental action in terms of the bylaws, the Regents stand ready to
consider such changes.

Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Laro then introduced and moved that the following
resolution on student representation at Regents' meetings be
approved:
The Regents understand the desire of the students for better corn-  Student
munication with the Board.                                             epresentation
Resolution
The Board believes that the recommendation of the Student Governance
Commission as to how this be done is inappropriate.
The Board will continue to consider other suggestions for ways in which
the communication with members of the University community can be
improved.

APPENDIX A
OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS
Characterizations by Harvey Jacobson, James Frenza
and Gilbert Goodwin
Conferred November 22, 1975
NATALIE Z. DAVIS, Doctor of Philosophy, 1959; historian.
We live in a time when we ought to be more aware than ever
before of the lessons of history. It is especially fitting, then, that
we honor you, for one of your aims has been to help us understand
the aspirations and struggles of the moment in light of the significant events and movements of the past.
Your innovative approach to historical research, particularly
your use of anthropological concepts, has made you a pioneer in
the study and interpretation of social and cultural activity. An
energetic person with interests in a wide area of human endeavor,
you have made vital contributions to the understanding of basic
human needs and accomplishments. Your studies of worker organizations, the effects of popular religion, and the role of women in
history are respected and admired among your peers. Your lectures
and your counseling are infused with that rare combination of
scholarship and enthusiasm that makes you a distinguished and
honored teacher.
You have earned widespread recognition as one of the country's
most respected historians. The University of Michigan is proud
to present to you its Outstanding Achievement Award.
EDMUND G. LOVE, Bachelor of Arts, 1936; Master of Arts,
1940; historian and author.
Few authors would attempt to write about such widely divergent locales as New York City and Flushing, Michigan. They
appear to have nothing in common.
But the Big Apple and rural America do have a great deal in
common. Both are inhabited by common people-and some not
so common-whose stories take on universal interest in the hands
of an artist as talented as Edmund G. Love.
Your versatility is evident in the wide range of your work.
The Situation in Flushing offers us a warm, nostalgic look at early
life in a small Michigan town. Subways Are for Sleeping is peopled
by nonconformists struggling to maintain a precarious existence

NOVEMBER MEETING, 1975


among the callous canyons of the city. Your chronicles in military
history bring needed clarity to campaigns of arms.
In all your works readers find the most rewarding of literary
gifts: the ability to observe shrewdly and accurately, to write
without pretention, and, best of all, to evoke a deep and satisfying
laughter.
The University of Michigan is delighted to witness such welldeserved critical acclaim and to present to a distinguished alumnus
this Outstanding Achievement Award.
RICHARD PERRY, Bachelor of Music, 1964; music producer.
In the highly competitive world of popular music recording,
you have achieved in remarkably few years a premier position in
the industry.
Your colleagues know you as a producer of records that transcend normal production standards. Your trademark is recordings
rich in musical value, alive with a welcome theatricality, and
marked with the distinctive personality of the individual performer.
Your clients range from Academy Award winners to rock and
bluegrass performers. Invariably, they remain loyal to you, for in
your creative talents they find a catalyst to their own.
The public is the ultimate beneficiary of your artistic and
engineering talents; its appreciation is best exemplified in your
many gold and platinum records, the coveted symbols of landmark
sales and popular acclaim.
The University of Michigan extends its congratulations to a
talented alumnus, and proudly presents to you this Outstanding
Achievement Award.

DECEMBER MEETING, 1975


Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of two faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted:
L. E. Brownell    LLOYD E. BROWNELL, Professor of Chemical, Metallurgical, and
Retirement Nuclear Engineering, retires from active faculty as of December 31, 1975,
after a most productive career as a teacher and researcher.
A native of New York, Professor Brownell took undergraduate and
graduate studies at Clarkson College of Technology and at The University of
Michigan, where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1947.
In 1947, Professor Brownell was appointed Assistant Professor; in 1950,
he was promoted to Associate Professor; and in 1954 to Professor of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering. In 1962, he was also appointed Professor
of Nuclear Engineering.
In 1954, Professor Brownell initiated research activities in the general
utilization of gross fission products for the preservation of foods and earned
an international reputation in the field of food technology or bio-engineering.
Simultaneously, Professor Brownell established a reputation in the design of
chemical process equipment and introduced the first modern approach of
flow-through porous media. About the same time, he expanded his research
activities into the study of interior ballistics. He had a long-term consulting
arrangement with Battelle Northwest and its successor, Atlantic Richfield
Hanford Company, involving research experiments of national importance.
He also has been a visiting professor at the College of Petroleum and Minerals at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
His innate capability of rapidly generating original ideas plus his investigative capability as a researcher enabled him to effectively develop his
ideas. He was also an innovative and effective teacher. As a highly successful
experimentalist, he has brought recognition to the University.
In recognition of this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service, the Regents are pleased to name him Professor Emeritus
of Chemical, Metallurgical, and Nuclear Engineering.
H. W. Falls    HAROLD F. FALLS, M.D., Professor of Ophthalmology, has retired
Retirement from active faculty status as of December 31, 1975, after a most productive
career in teaching, research, service, and administration.
Doctor Falls received the M.D. degree in 1936 from The University of
Michigan and completed his internship and residency here at University
Hospital. He joined the faculty as an Instructor in 1938, continuing through
the academic ranks to become Professor of Ophthalmology in 1959.
Doctor Falls had a distinguished career in the Department of Ophthalmology over many years. His contributions to the understanding of ophthalmic genetics and developmental diseases are well-known. He served
unselfishly on many Hospital committees and was active in the leadership
of Hospital staff. His concern for his patients is reflected by their loyalty to
him. His many skills will be difficult to replace in the department and the
Hospital.
Doctor Falls is well-known and esteemed nationally. He has been active
in both the American Medical Association and the American Academy of
Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology for many years.
The Regents now salute this distinguished physician and educator for
his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Ophthalmology.
ViB. DEATHS
No deaths were reported to the Regents.

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREES
Characterizations by Harvey Jacobson, James Frenza, and
Gilbert Goodwin
Conferred December 14, 1975
KARL WOLFGANG DEUTSCH, political scientist; Professor at
Harvard University.
Rare is the scholar who transcends the normal boundaries of a discipline and helps transform it in the manner of Dr. Karl Wolfgang Deutsch.
As a scholar of the nation-state and the international system, you have
been devotedly preoccupied with generating and analyzing data-testing
theories about the functioning of the political order. In this effort you have
been instrumental in the movement to change political science from a
philosophical discipline to a true social science.
A broad-gauged and internationally educated social scientist, equally
adept in the contrasting currents of economics, sociology, and psychology,
you have combined in your work the virtues of the generalist of an older
period and the methodological sophistication so pertinent today.
Because you are constantly searching and learning, you are forever
contributing-to your colleagues, to your students, and to the literature.
The University of Michigan is privileged to have shared so abundantly
in the time and attentions of a distinguished thinker, teacher, researcher,
author, and world statesman in the social sciences. We are honored to
present to you the degree Doctor of Laws.
SEYMOUR JACOB KRESHOVER, Director, National Institute of
Dental Research; Assistant Surgeon General, United States Public Health
Service.
It can be said of very few individuals that their work has an effect on
most of their countrymen. Your ideas, and the scope of your activity, will
enable you to have a strong and positive impact on the health of almost
every American.
You have broadened the understanding and execution of dental research, and under your remarkable leadership, dental practice is changing
from a largely restorative to a preventive discipline. Your imaginative and
pioneering approach has led to the establishment of centers which bring
dental research into the mainstream of modern biology and clinical science.
In all your research, administrative, and governmental responsibilities,
you have acted with a rare degree of compassion and concern. Out of your
efforts, and the efforts of those who are inspired by your forceful leadership
and perceptive guidance, have come concepts, methods, and legislation
which help improve the dental health of us all.
The potential of dentistry to become the first component of the health
professions to achieve the goal of disease prevention is attributable in large
measure to your efforts. The University of Michigan takes pride in your
work, and confers upon you the degree Doctor of Science.




184              DECEMBER MEETING, 1975
ALICE MITCHELL RIVLIN, economist; Director of the Congres.
sional Budget Office.
The generous American, traditionally ready to dig deep in pocket to
ameliorate the basic problems of society, has come to realize that spending
without planning may be wasteful and almost no help at all.
That the United States Congress shares in this concern is indicated by
the establishment of the new Congressional Budget Office, whose functions
include the setting of spending priorities. It is fortunate that the pioneer
work of this important agency is in your extremely capable hands.
Dr. Rivlin, your rise as a distinguished economist, your influential work
with government agencies, your research and writing on problems associated
with social action and federal spending, and most of all your record as a
concerned and involved citizen, reassure us that your selection as first
director of the Congressional Budget Office was an enlightened decision in
the best interest of us all.
We share your hope that the application of experimental methodology
to social issues will yield more meaningful policies of human investmentpolicies more extensive in benefit, yet more cost effective in implementation.
In recognition of your distinguished achievements and the promise
inherent in your present responsibilities, The University of Michigan is
proud to confer upon you the degree Doctor of Laws.

Two off-campus assignments, ninety sabbatical leaves, twentynine leaves without salary, four medical leaves, six retirement furloughs, one early retirement furlough, and four extensions of leaves
of absence without salary were reported to the Regents and

IX. DEGREES
On recommendation of the Dean of the Horace H. Rackham Degree List
School of Graduate Studies, the August 1975 Master of Arts in  Aded
Education degree list was amended to add the name of Joyce Ann
Langhals, B. S., University of Dayton.
X. FINANCE-PROPERTY
President Fleming stated that at the December meeting the  PIRGIM
Regents had approved the continuation of the PIRGIM fee collection system for the winter term with a modification which
enables students to indicate their preference to credit their account
rather than pay the fee by returning a form received with their
tuition billing. At the same time, the Regents asked the Committee to suggest alternative procedures and requested an opinion
on the legality of the system.
The Committee recommended that the present system be appraised in March. This would allow sufficient time for student
reaction to the modified refund system approved for the winter
term.
The opinion of the General Counsel suggested that an automatic assessment is an involuntary procedure, even though an
opportunity is given for refund. It, therefore, raises significant
legal questions.
Regent Laro then expressed concern about the legality of the
system and about the burden of the refunding process being imposed upon those students who did not wish to contribute to
PIRGIM. He suggested that a system which required affirmative
authorization by the student would be more appropriate.
Regent Laro then moved that effective for the period after
Winter Term, we consider a legal method of collection of the
PIRGIM fee which will require the students' affirmative authorization. He further resolved that the Executive Officers, after
consultation with the Committee to Study PIRGIM Funding and
the University Community, recommend a funding mechanism to
meet these criteria. Regent Roach seconded the motion.




192


JANUARY MEETING, 1976


Regent Roach said that the criticism he had received was twofold: the use of the University to collect these fees and the mandatory assessment which puts the burden of requesting a refund
upon the student. He stated that indications suggest criticism
will continue. Therefore, rather than delay the issue, a new procedure should be recommended.
Regents Baker and Brown expressed their concern regarding
legal problems with the procedure. They felt that adequate funding
of the program was not the primary concern of the Regents. But
fairness to all students was a matter for their attention.
Regent Nederlander then stated that since there had not been
adequate time to study the Attorney's opinion on this issue he
moved to table the motion until the Regents' meeting in February.
Regent Brown seconded the motion and it was adopted, with
Regents Laro and Baker voting no.
vesmnpts oraIt  A report on Temporary Investments was received.
Housing Rates  A report on proposed increases in 1976-77 housing rates was
Proposed, 1976-77 received by the Regents.
All of the above actions were by unanimous vote unless otherwise indicated.

Regents reported for the month of December 1975 totaled $554.66.
The Regents adjourned to meet on February 4.

VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported to the Regents the deaths of Paul
A. Hunsicker, Associate Director and Professor of Physical Education, and Walter H. Swartz, Professor of Dentistry. The following
memorial statements were adopted:
The Regents of the University acknowledge with great sorrow the death
of PAUL A. HUNSICKER, Associate Director and Professor of Physical
Education, on January 14, 1976, at the age of 59.
Dr. Hunsicker was born on October 9, 1916, in New York City, and
attended the Savage School of Physical Education prior to transferring to
Syracuse University, where he received his Bachelor of Science degree in
1939. He received his Master of Science degree from Springfield College in
1941, and his doctoral degree at the University of Illinois in 1949.
Dr. Hunsicker taught at Springfield College and at the University of
Illinois, before joining the Michigan faculty as Assistant Professor of Physical
Education in 1949. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1953, and to
full Professor in 1957. Named Chairman of the Department of Physical
Education for Men in 1958, he became Associate Director of Physical Education in 1968.
Long interested in problems related to physical fitness and the physiology
of exercise, Dr. Hunsicker did the pioneer classic studies of youth fitness in
the United States, and in 1965, received the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
Physical Fitness Leader award at ceremonies in Washington, D.C. He served
on the President's Council for Youth Fitness and was a consultant in the
administrations of both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Instrumental in
organizing the research section of the Michigan Association for Health,
Physical Education, and Recreation, he served as consultant to the Canadian
Association for Health, Physical Education, and Research on its National
Fitness Survey.
A noted researcher, he spoke at fitness meetings across the world, and
was the author of numerous publications. He was co-author of "Applied

FEBRUARY MEETING, 1976


Tests and Measurements in Physical Education" and "Physical Fitness in
Athletic Champions."
During World War II, Dr. Hunsicker served in the Army Air Corps and
held the rank of Captain.
The Regents now extend their sincerest sympathies to his wife and
family and join the University community in mourning his loss.
W. H. Swartz    It is with a deep sense of loss that the Regents of the University
Memioal acknowledge the death of Dr. WALTER H. SWARTZ, Professor of Dentistry, who died January 13, 1976, at the age of 53.
Born on February 19, 1922, in Marcellus, Michigan, he attended the
Western Michigan College of Education for two years, before transferring
to the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, where he received his
Doctor of Dental Surgery degree in 1945, and his Master of Science degree
in 1947.
After graduation in 1945, Dr. Swartz became a Clinical Instructor in the
School of Dentistry, subsequently rising through the ranks to full Professor
in 1961.
His colleagues at the Dental School found in him a rare combination of
excellence as a scholar, a private practitioner, an educational, professional
and civic leader, and most importantly, a teacher revered by his students.
Dr. Swartz was the only faculty member in the history of the School of
Dentistry, to be selected three times by senior students to receive the school's
Paul Gibbons award for outstanding teaching.
A past president of the Washtenaw District Dental Society and the
Ann Arbor Civic Club, a Fellow of the American College of Dentistry, and
former secretary of the Michigan State Dental Association's Government
Affairs Committee, Dr. Swartz also was director of the Prosthodontic Committee of the International Association for Dental Research.
Nationally known for his research and publications in dentistry, Dr.
Swartz was among the few Americans invited to make a research presentation at the International Association of Dental Research meeting last March
in London, England.
The Regents now join the entire University community in mourning
his passing and extend their deepest sympathies to his family.

X. OTHER
Housing Rates  Regent Nederlander moved that increases in 1976-77 housing
Increased
rates, as recommended by Vice-President Johnson, be approved.
Regent Power seconded the motion and it was adopted.
In this connection, Regent Nederlander stated that the Regents
regretted having to approve this increase, but it could not be
avoided this year.
PIRGIM    President Fleming commented that a motion concerning the
adoption of an affirmative check-off plan for the collection of fees
for the Public Interest Research Group in Michigan (PIRGIM)
had been tabled at the January meeting of the Regents. He asked
the Secretary to read the motion so that action could be taken
at this time. The following motion was made by Regent Laro
and seconded by Regent Roach:
"Effective for the period after the Winter Term, we consider
a legal method of collection of the PIRGIM fee which will require
the students' affirmative authorization." He further resolved that
the Executive Officers, after consultation with the Committee to
Study PIRGIM Funding and the University Community, recommend a funding mechanism to meet these criteria.
Regent Roach then stated that the PIRGIM program apparently has many supporters. However, there is significant adverse
criticism regarding the negative check-off system. To be fair to all
factions of the University community, an affirmative authorization
system should be adopted.
Regent Baker commented that funds to support the program
should be obtained from those interested in PIRGIM. The organization now has an automatic fund-raising system, using the University to collect its fees. He said that he was in full support of
an affirmative approach.
Regent Brown stated that, in his view, fairness was not the
issue to be considered. He said the real issue involved University
procedure. The original referendum was approved by a majority
of the student community who supported the negative system.
When presented to the Regents for approval, this was changed
to the affirmative system, and PIRGIM accepted this. The negative check-off system returned with the advent of the computer
registration system, and criticism against it has been substantial.
Regent Brown maintained that the proper way to change this
procedure is by legislative process. Those opposing the system
should come forth with a clear mandate to abolish it.




FEBRUARY MEETING, 1976


199


Regent Laro commented that the issue was not the survival
of PIRGIM if an affirmative check-off system is used, as representatives of the organization have claimed. He said if the method
of collection is the criterion for survival then perhaps it should not
continue. He did not consider it fair or proper for the University
to put the burden of seeking a refund on students who do not
want to support the organization. He also questioned the appropriateness of the University acting as a collection agency for an
independent organization.
President Fleming then asked for the vote. The motion failed,
with Regents Brown, Dunn, Nederlander, Power, and Waters
voting no.
Regent Power then moved that the present system be continued
for a one-year period, from May 1, 1976 to April 30, 1977, and
that the President report to the Regents no later than January
1977 with an evaluation of the present system and any proposed
alternatives. Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it was adopted,
with Regents Baker, Laro, and Roach voting no.
Regent Nederlander then stated that PIRGIM was the first
group to work within University procedures after the turbulence
of the late '60s and early '70s. The group presented a responsible
and highly motivated program which impressed everyone. The
Regents have not changed their view of the merits of the organization, but realize it is difficult to please everyone. The Regents
have been objective in considering all sides of the issue and would
continue to do so in the future.
Regent Dunn moved that the following amendment of Bylaw        Bylaw: Sec. 5.13
Section 5.13, dealing with political and governmental service of  Revised
faculty and staff, be approved:
Sec. 5.13 Governmental Activities. The holding of public office by staff
members is considered desirable and those seeking such office should be
encouraged.
Any regular staff member who becomes a candidate for any elective
public office shall, upon the filing of that candidacy, notify the Secretary of
the University in writing of the candidacy and file with him a statement
from the appropriate supervisor, department head, or dean that arrangements
have been made and approved by him to assure that the candidacy will not
interfere with the performance of University employment duties. Upon
request, such candidates shall be given a leave of absence without salary
during the period of the actual campaign.
All regular staff members who are elected to a public office and any
regular staff member who is appointed to a public office shall file with the
Secretary of the University a statement from the appropriate supervisor,
department head, or dean that arrangements have been made and approved
by him to assure that the duties of the office will not interfere with the performance of University employment duties. If such assurance cannot be
made, the staff member shall either request leave of absence without salary
or resign effective upon the commencement of governmental duties or upon




200


FEBRUARY MEETING, 1976


expiration of previously granted leave. If the staff member requests leave of
absence without salary, such leave shall be granted by the President for the
period of one term of office, if any, or for one year. Leaves without salary
for additional terms of office, if any, or additional years of service may be
granted by the President on recommendation by the dean or appropriate
administrative officer.
Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Medical Service   The Regents received a report on the strategy for implementation of the Medical Service Plan.
All of the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
Regents reported for the month of January 1976 totaled $829.37.
The Regents adjourned to meet on March 18 and 19.

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of three faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted:
HAZEL D. CALHOUN, M.A., Assistant Professor of Electroencepha-     H. D. Calhoun
lographic Technology in the Departments of Surgery and Psychiatry, retired  Retirement
from active faculty status after a most productive career in instruction and
research.
Miss Calhoun has made notable contribution, not only to the joint
research programs of the Laboratory of Electroencephalography and Section
of Neurosurgery, but to many other internal and cooperative studies as
well. The results of these contributions are fully documented by her extensive
bibliography. She was a member of a team of workers that has delved into
the intricate relationships between the clinical symptomatology and the




270


MARCH MEETING, 1976


disordered electrical activity of the brain of the epileptic in the process of
selecting candidates for surgical treatment. This cooperative endeavor has
greatly benefited the EEG Laboratory since it has kept members of its staff
and Laboratory trainees in close touch with the teaching material afforded
by the Section of Neurosurgery. Surgical follow-up has provided a valuable
way of verifying the reliability and validity of electrographic studies.
Miss Calhoun is one of the charter members of the Board of Registration
of the American Society of Electroencephalographic Technicians, serving on
the Committee to organize and evaluate the first examination. She is most
highly regarded by her peers and is frequently sought out for advice on
matters of electroencephalographic technique and laboratory operation. Miss
Calhoun has been responsible for the training of a large number of electroencephalographic technicians over the years. She directed the formal, sixmonth course of lectures in electroencephalographic technology which is
conducted annually. EEG Fellows and residents from Neurology and other
services rotating through Neurosurgery service frequently went to Miss
Calhoun for advice on instrumental and technical problems.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for her distinguished and dedicated service by naming her Assistant Professor Emeritus.
J. W. Conn     JEROME W. CONN, M.D., Professor of Internal Medicine, retired
Retirement from active faculty status after a most productive career as teacher and
researcher.
Dr. Conn was graduated from the University of Michigan Medical
School in 1932 and served on the U-M Medical School faculty from 1934 to
1974. He is well known for his studies and publications related to control of
obesity, classification, causes and treatment of various hypoglycemic states,
diabetes and acclimatization to heat. Dr. Conn is best known for his pioneering studies which led to the recognition and first description in 1954 of primary aldosteronism or Conn's Syndrome, a curable form of hypertension due
to an adrenal cortical tumor secreting excessive amounts of aldosterine.
Subsequently he improved on diagnostic methods for the earlier recognition
of asymptomatic patients with primary aldosteronism.
Among the numerous awards he has received are the Claude Bernard
Medal, the Banting Medal and the Banting Memorial Award, the Henry
Russel Lectureship Award of The University of Michigan, the Phillips
Memorial Award from the American College of Physicians, Honorary Doctor
of Science Degree from Rutgers University, Heath Memorial Award and
Medal from the University of Texas, Annual Award for Distinguished
Achievement from the American College of Nutrition, Honorary Doctor of
Medicine from the University of Turin, Italy, International Prize of the
Gairdner Foundation, Toronto, Canada, International Stouffer Prize and
Gold Medal for Research in Hypertension, and Gold Medal of the International Society for Progress in Internal Medicine, Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Dr. Conn was named by The University of Michigan Regents Henry
Russel lecturer for 1960-61 and was awarded a Distinguished University
Professorship in the name of Louis Harry Newburgh. In 1969 Dr. Conn was
elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences of the United
States of America and, in 1970, became a charter member of the Institute of
Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1973 Dr. Conn was
named a United States Veterans Administration Distinguished Physician,
one of twelve in the nation.
The Regents now salute this distinguished health educator for his distinguished and dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of
Internal Medicine.
A. W. Melton     ARTHUR W. MELTON, Professor of Psychology, retires from       the
Retirement University after an illustrious career marked by distinguished contributions
to science and to the university community. Having joined the faculty in




MARCH MEETING, 1976


271


1957, Professor Melton, who had conceived the possibility of a Human Performance Center at the University, played a central role in its creation and
served with distinction as its Director. Under his aegis the work of the
Center caught national attention, adding visibility to the research contributions of the University in a key area of investigation.
Professor Melton has long been regarded as one of the deans of experimental psychology, having been elected President of the Division of Experimental Psychology of the American Psychological Association as well as
President of its Society of Engineering Psychologists. He served as Chairman
of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs and the Association's Council of
Editors and member of the APA Board of Directors. One of the roles in
which he was best known was that of Editor of the prestigious Journal of
Experimental Psychology, where for 12 years he set standards of excellence
for the field of psychology. His election to the National Academy of Sciences
capped a brilliant career as scientist and teacher.
The Regents are pleased to name Arthur W. Melton Professor Emeritus
of Psychology.

IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
The Regents received a report on University properties out- Properties,
side the city of Ann Arbor.                                 University
Vice-President Pierpont commented upon his recommendation  Observatory,
to raze the 1908 addition to the University Observatory. He ex- University
plained that this addition was incompatible with the original
structure built in 1854 and that it had deteriorated beyond
feasible renovation. He then read a portion of the letter to the
National Register of Historic Places nominating the Observatory:
"Only minor alterations have been made to the Observatory,
which houses a number of early instruments and fittings other
than that described above. Additions have been made, however, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These
were particularly unfortunate in that the mass and materials
of the additions are incompatible with the original building
and completely dwarf it. From several angles the original
Observatory is obscured from view. For these reasons only
the original Observatory is nominated."
He also read a portion of a letter written by A. Craig Morrison,
Architect with the National Park Service to then President Harlan
Hatcher, dated December 16, 1965:
"Preservation of the Observatory is not only desirable, but

MARCH MEETING, 1976


would seem to be economically feasible. With the removal of
the large addition, built in 1908, which encumbers rather than
enhances the original building, the place would be small in
size and not costly to heat and maintain."
Vice-President Pierpont said that the Lake Erie Astronomical
Project of Ohio had expressed an interest in securing certain
piers, cross axis mounting and parts.
Regent Nederlander moved that authorization be given to
demolish the 1908 addition and allow the Lake Erie Astronomical
Project to secure certain mountings. Regent Brown seconded the
motion and it was adopted.
Regent Power suggested that appropriate groups in the State
of Michigan be given the opportunity to purchase or otherwise
obtain the mountings.
Vice-President Pierpont replied that the University would be
willing to discuss the matter with anyone interested

In response to the request for a regental position on Senator
Earl Nelson's legislation proposing a tax increase, Regent Roach
moved that the following resolution be adopted:
The erosion of State support for higher education in Michigan was
documented in a recent release from the staff of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The implications of this under-funding on the quality
of education is a matter of great concern to the Regents of The University of Michigan.
For the reasons indicated, the Regents are addressing this plea to
both the executive and legislative branches of the government to take
whatever measures are necessary, including a tax increase, to stem the
deterioration which is taking place in higher education. It will be far
more difficult to restore quality in higher education than to preserve it.
We will do everything we can to support measures which will make
the necessary funding possible.
Regent Dunn seconded the motion and it failed, with Regents
Baker, Brown, Nederlander, Power, Waters, and Laro voting no.
Regent Baker said he did not support this resolution because
he felt that it was too specific. Perhaps alternatives other than
raising taxes were available to gain needed revenue.
Regent Dunn then moved that the following resolution be
approved as amended:
The erosion of State support for higher education in Michigan was
documented in a recent release from the staff of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The implications of this under-funding on the quality
of education is a matter of great concern to the Regents of The University of Michigan. For the reasons indicated, the Regents are addressing
this plea to both the executive and legislative branches of the government to take whatever measures are necessary to generate additional
revenues in order to stem the deterioration which is taking place in
higher education. It will be far more difficult to restore quality in higher
education than to preserve it.
We will do everything we can to support measures which will make
the necessary funding possible.
Regent Waters seconded the motion and it was adopted.
The Regents authorized Chancellor Moran to proceed with

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
R. C. Stewart    The following memoir was adopted by the Regents:
Retirement
ROLLAND CLIFFORD STEWART, Associate Director of the University Library, retired from active status as of June 30, 1975, after a very
productive career as a librarian and library administrator. After receiving
his bachelor's degree from the University of Tennessee, Mr. Stewart took a
master's degree in Romance Languages at The University of Michigan. Following brief service as an instructor in the Romance Languages Departments
of The University of Michigan and the University of Missouri, Mr. Stewart
enrolled in the Department of Library Science here and earned a degree in
librarianship from that department. He became a member of the staff of the
University Library in 1938 and rose to the position of chief bibliographer.
In 1955 he was made Assistant to the Director and Head of the Book Selection Department. In 1960 he was appointed Assistant Director of the Library
and, in 1967, Associate Director. During his career Mr. Stewart held administrative responsibility successively for the technical and public services
branches of the library, but his major contribution was his constant and
highly successful effort to develop and improve the library's collections. In
this all-important area of librarianship, his familiarity with the library's
holdings, his broad knowledge of book publishing in the western world
and his judgment in book selection made him invaluable and won him the
great respect of his colleagues and the faculty. He was responsible for the
selection of the initial book collection for our Undergraduate Library whose
catalog served for many years as a guide to many other universities developing their own undergraduate libraries. Mr. Stewart has served frequently as
a consultant in book selection to other institutions and assumed responsibility
for the development of the ability of other members of our library staff in
this field of librarianship. His contribution to the development of our library
resources is incalculable. To a significant extent the quality of our library
holdings is a consequence of his ministrations and judgment.
The Regents now salute this distinguished librarian for his dedicated
service by naming him Associate Director Emeritus of the University Library.
VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported to the Regents the deaths of
Alvan Obelsky, Professor of Economics, UM-Dearborn, and
Leonard Zamiska, Professor of Art. The following memorial statements were adopted:
A. Obelsky     Born on February 19, 1926, Professor OBELSKY received his secondary
Memorial education at Boston Latin before going on to become an economics major
Statement at the University of Massachusetts. In 1950 he received an M.A. in Far
Eastern and Russian studies at Yale University before returning to economics
with an M.A. in 1951 from The University of Michigan. After several years
of college teaching he resumed his graduate work at The University of
Michigan where he was awarded a Ph.D. in economics in 1961.




APRIL MEETING, 1976


289


Professor Obelsky was a lecturer at the Ann Arbor campus from 1951 to
1961 and had a full-time appointment at the Dearborn campus thereafter.
He was promoted to associate professor in 1964, to full professor in 1973.
During the first years of the Dearborn campus, Professor Obelsky was
practically synonomous with economics, a task which a man of narrower
interests might have found burdensome. Despite his heavy and varied teaching load, Professor Obelsky became a noted specialist on the Japanese
economy, publishing widely in Japanese professional publications. At the
time of his death, he was completing books on Japanese economic development and on comparative economic systems. Professor Obelsky's students
were able to benefit, furthermore, by his personal familiarity with Japanese
culture based on several extended stays as a Fulbright lecturer as well as on
his fluency in the Japanese language.
Professor Obelsky was widely valued by his colleagues as a knowledgeable member of the academic community. His fellow economists will miss
him as the senior member of their discipline.
It is with a deep sense of regret that the Regents acknowledge the death  L. Zamiska
of LEONARD ZAMISKA, Professor of Art, who died April 2, at the age      Memorial
of 50.                                                                  Statement
Professor Zamiska was born in Cleveland, Ohio on November 6, 1925
and was named art director for the public relations department of the
Cleveland Planning Commission.
In 1950, Professor Zamiska joined the art faculty at the University of
Illinois where he taught design advertising, drawing, anatomy, and lettering.
In 1956, he came to The University of Michigan as an Assistant Professor of Art, and in 1957, was named museum associate in the U-M Museum
of Art. Professor Zamiska was appointed Professor of Art in 1966.
During the University's Sesquicentennial celebration in 1967, Professor
Zamiska was the official designer and design coordinator. In addition, his
caligraphy and lettering have been used widely throughout the University
for publications and posters. His paintings have been frequently displayed
at art exhibitions throughout the mid-west and he also was the focus of
several one-man exhibits.
His unique qualifications and his experience as a teacher of lettering,
layout, typography, and photography were a valuable addition to the departmental program in design and his abilities as a painter added depth to his
classroom  activities. On several occasions, Mr. Zamiska demonstrated his
loyalty and affection for the University by declining to transfer his skills
to professional practice. He is remembered by his colleagues for the enthusiasm with which he undertook his responsibilities and for his willingness to
assume extra duties and departmental activities.
The Regents now join his colleagues and students in sending their sincere
sympathies to his wife and family and in mourning his untimely death.

APRIL MEETING, 1976


X. OTHER
Bylaw:    Regent Baker moved that an administrative transfer of the
Sec. 11.135
Revised Kresge Hearing Research Institute to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Medical School and the following revision of
Bylaw  11.135 be approved. Regent Nederlander seconded the
motion and it was adopted:
Section 11.135. THE MEDICAL SCHOOL-THE KRESGE HEARING RESEARCH
INSTITUTE. The Kresge Hearing Research Institute shall conduct research
into the cause and treatment of disorders of hearing and communication.
The Institute shall be a unit of the Department of Otorhinolryngology of
the Medical School. It shall be in charge of a Director appointed by the
Board on recommendation by the Chairman of the Department, the Dean
of the Medical School, and the President. The Director shall be a member of
the regular instructional staff of the Medical School in the Department of
Otorhinolaryngology. The Director shall be assisted by an Advisory Committee of the faculty appointed by the Chairman of the Department, with
the concurrence of the Dean. The Director shall be responsible to the Chairman of the Department.
Medical/Dental  Regent Nederlander moved that the membership applications
Staff Membership
Approved to the Medical/Dental staff be approved. Regent Waters seconded
the motion and it was adopted.
B.Mus.Ed. Degree  The Regents approved the request to grant the Bachelor of, pproveMusic Education (B.Mus.Ed.) degree at The University of Michigan-Flint.
Central Student  The Regents received a report on the history of Central StuGovernment        Rgn
Report dent Government at The University of Michigan.
Memberships   The Regents approved the request for membership in the
pproveAmerican Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.
The Regents approved the request for membership in the
Industrial Designers Society of America.
Recombinant   With regard to the Recombinant DNA research issues, Presiesearcdent Fleming posed two questions for the Regents' consideration:
what time-table did they wish to follow in deciding the issue; and
what manner and extent of community involvement did they feel
would be helpful in the process?
From a timing standpoint, the President indicated that the
Senate Assembly would soon be discussing the Committee B
report and would likely emerge with a recommendation. Similarly,
the officers will consider the report and forward their recommendation. If the Regents desired, additional written comments
could be solicited from interested community groups and distributed to the Regents before their May meeting. A further discussion, arranged for the May meeting, could suffice to allow a
decision in May.




APRIL MEETING, 1976


293


All members of the Board of Regents agreed that the final
decision must rest with them.
Regent Dunn commented that because this was such an important issue, more information was needed before a responsible
decision could be reached. Experts in this particular field of
research and citizens of the community should be invited to a
public meeting for an in-depth discussion of the subject.
President Fleming responded that this could be arranged.
Regent Baker stated that the basic issue is free inquiry, which
is the purpose of the University, and that emphasis should be
placed on the merits of the case.
Regents Brown and Laro expressed their interest in receiving
more scientific data as to the safety, risks, and benefits of the
research before arriving at a decision.
Regent Roach then moved that the item, and all preliminary
procedures, be placed on the agenda for a decision in May, with
the understanding that it could be deferred until June if necessary.
Regent Laro seconded the motion. The motion failed, with Regents
Brown, Dunn, Waters, and Power voting no.
Regent Power then stated that she was concerned with the
process by which the decision will be reached. The magnitude
of the issue is awesome; therefore, time is needed for appropriate
dialogue on the merits of the case. She cited a number of elements
which are important to the decision-making process: Committee
B's report has just been received and there has not yet been time
for analysis and critique of it; others in the University community
who will be affected by this research should have the opportunity
to make their views known; the wider community should be considered; there should be provision for input from the legislature;
governmental guidelines, still under discussion, need to be reviewed; research should be considered within the overall academic
and research priorities of The University of Michigan; and the
costs of both conducting the research and, even more importantly,
of appropriately monitoring it, should be analyzed and evaluated.
Regent Power also expressed her concern that the Regents
have the benefit of a presentation on the merits and liabilities
of Recombinant DNA research by persons of national prominence
outside of the University community.
She said the University community values and respects the
role of dialogue in the decision-making process. Accordingly, she
suggested, inasmuch as this is probably one of the most important
issues on which the Board will ever have to make a decision, that
an overall plan of review and evaluation should be prepared for




294


APRIL MEETING, 1976


the May meeting. She felt that the subject was one on which the
University could not arbitrarily set a time limit for decision.
Regent Nederlander then moved that the issue be placed on
the agenda in May and that the administration should supply information and make preparations for a discussion, as requested
by the Regents, in ample time to provide the means for a discussion and perhaps a decision. Regent Brown seconded the motion
and it was adopted, with Regent Power voting no.
1976-77 Budget   President Fleming then read the following statement conand Tuition
Schedule cerning the 1976-77 budget:
We are acutely aware that in this period of financial exigency, students
are troubled over how much tuition will rise in the Fall of 1976, and faculty
and staff are concerned with erosion in their economic status due to inflation.
We had hoped that we could in the month of April bring to the Regents
a budget for 1976-77. It is now evident that this is impossible. The Governor
has submitted one budget bill which provides for no incremental dollars
in 1976-77, while the Senate has passed a bill which would give The University of Michigan approximately $2.6 million over the amount allotted
by the Governor. It is unlikely that we will know which bill, if either, will
pass until the very end of June. This being so, we cannot exactly define at
this time the nature of the internal steps which we must take to balance
the budget.
Because of the legitimate concern which the academic community has
in next year's budget, the Regents have authorized the release of tentative
decisions which reveals the major items under consideration for the 1976-77
budget.
On the expense side of the ledger, imposed costs, such as utility rate
increases, very modest adjustments in current accounts which lag badly,
additional student financial aid, and compensation adjustments in the neighborhood of 5 per cent will amount to some $10 million. We shall supplement
the General Fund Student Aid account, and provide additional support for
student work and loan programs.
In order to meet these increased costs we will have to both reduce our
current budget allocations and raise tuition. Approximately $5 million in
cuts have been identified and will be given careful study by the deans, vice
presidents, and the Committee on Budget Administration. We hope that
insofar as this involves any reduction in personnel, it will be done by attrition or the removal of vacant positions. Tuition will need to rise between
9 and 10 per cent, with a somewhat higher increase, as recommended, in the
Law School. These increases will bring in about $5 million in additional
revenue. The total of these budget reductions and fee increases, together with
an increase in revenue from indirect costs, will balance our increased expenditures.
Despite the change in the State's fiscal year so that it begins on
October 1, it is our expectation that salary changes under the above program
will be made on September 1, 1976.
The Chancellors of the Dearborn and Flint campuses stated
that their tuition increases would be about the same as for the
Ann Arbor campus, but the fees for part-time students would be
somewhat less in order to bring these rates more in line with fulltime fees.




APRIL MEETING, 1976


295


Vice-President Rhodes commented that further study on parttime fees was underway at this time and would be brought to the
Regents at a later date.
Regent Roach expressed his regret at having to increase tuition
this year, but felt it was the only alternative if we are to maintain
the University's status of excellence.
Regent Roach then moved that the 1976-77 budget and
tuition schedule, be approved as recommended. Regent Power
seconded the motion and it was adopted.
A report on possible joint construction and operation of a
Fine Arts Building at UM-Dearborn was received.
Linda Iskow received a response from Vice-President Rhodes.
All of the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of March 1976 totaled $454.35.
The Regents adjourned to meet on May 20 and 21.

VI. RETIREMENT MEMOIRS
Secretary Kennedy reported the retirement of four faculty
members. The following memoirs were adopted.
JAMES C. COSTELLO, Associate Professor of Architecture retires from  J. C. Costello
his duties effective 31 May 1976.                                        Retirement
Professor Costello left his private engineering practice in Ireland in 1964
to join the architecture faculty in the College of Architecture and Design.
He brought warmth and wit, a diversity of interests, a sharpness of intellect
and a generous Irish spirit. Over the years he developed an exceptional
rapport with students, who found him always available and generous with
his time.
A teacher of structures theory, Professor Costello spent many days and
nights, in the design studio as a "consultant" to the students on structural
and mechanical problems encountered in their design proposals. According
to the students, he approached problems in such a way as to compel them
to think for themselves. A teacher can do no better.
The Regents now salute this buoyant and respected teacher for his many
contributions to the life of the College and the University by naming him
Associate Professor Emeritus of Architecture.
OLIVER EDEL, Professor of Music, has retired from     active faculty  0. Edel
status as of May 31, 1976, after a most productive career as a teacher and  Retirement
performing artist.
A native of New York, Professor Edel attended the St. Thomas Choir
School in New York City and the Carteret Academy in Orange, New Jersey,
after which he became a student at the Manhattan School of Music, graduating in 1926. He received the Artist Diploma from the Conservatoire
Americain, Fontainebleau, in 1925. From 1928 until 1937 he performed as
Cellist with the Manhattan String Quartet. He joined the Roth Quartet as
Cellist in 1938, serving with that group until 1944. During all of these years
and until 1947, he was very active as a cello soloist and also as a conductor. He also gave attention to the teaching of the cello and of chamber
music for strings, serving at the Manhattan School of Music, 1928-47, and at
Brigham Young University, 1941-44.
In 1947 Professor Edel joined the faculty of the School of Music of
The University of Michigan as Associate Professor and was promoted to the
rank of Professor in 1951. His outstanding abilities as a teacher attracted
very outstanding students to the University. He was a founding member
of the Stanley Quartet and served as Cellist with this organization until
1961. Professor Edel began teaching at the University Division of the
National Music Camp in the summer of 1956, and still continues with this
activity. Throughout his career he was imaginative and creative, contributing greatly to the reputation of the School of Music and of its string
department.
The Regents now salute this distinguished artist and teacher for his
dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Music.
ALICE KERN, Professor of Music, has retired from      active faculty  A. Kern
status as of May 31, 1976, after a most productive career as a teacher and  Retirement
author.
A native of Illinois, Professor Kern was educated in Alabama and received the Bachelor of Music degree from Alabama College in 1926. She
subsequently studied at the Eastman School of Music, the University of
Georgia, Northwestern University, Fresno State College, and The University of Michigan, receiving her Master of Music degree from the latter institution in 1949. From 1926 to 1948, Professor Kern taught music in a




312


MAY MEETING, 1976


variety of public schools in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi, serving as
Supervisor of Music in the Baldwin County High School of Bay Minette,
Alabama, from 1938 to 1948. In 1949 she joined the faculty of the School
of Music of The University of Michigan as an Instructor in Piano. She
was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1954, to Associate Professor in 1960,
and to Professor in 1965. She was responsible for working out the elaborate
and highly successful program in class piano instruction offered by the
School of Music, serving as chairman of a large department of instructors
and as coordinator of the entire instructional program. This work brought
her a national reputation and led to the production of several textbooks
which have enjoyed wide use in schools of music all over the United States.
She served nationally as an officer in many organizations including Sigma
Alpha Iota, Pi Kappa Lambda, and the Music Teachers National Association. Her entire career was characterized by her capacity to combine high
musical standards with sound pedagogical principles.
The Regents now salute this distinguished pianist and teacher for her
dedicated service by naming her Professor Emeritus of Music.
J. Kollen    JOHN KOLLEN, Professor of Music, has retired from active faculty
Retirement status as of May 31, 1976, after a most productive career as a teacher,
artist, and researcher.
A native of Michigan, Professor Kollen undertook undergraduate studies
at Hope College after graduating from the public schools of Holland,
Michigan. Before and after this formal education in the United States, he
studied privately in Berlin, Germany and in Paris, France.
He came to The University of Michigan in 1934 as an Instructor in
the School of Music and subsequently appeared in numerous solo recitals
as well as concerto appearances with the University Symphony Orchestra.
As a scholar, Professor Kollen has contributed immensely to our knowledge
of Robert Schumann, and he continues to work in this very important field
of musicology. As a teacher of piano, he has produced many students who
occupy very important positions today in the world of music. Professor
Kollen is a member of Pi Kappa Lambda and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia. He
is the principal organizer and coordinator for the School of Music Faculty
Chamber Concerts.
The Regents now salute this distinguished pianist, scholar, and teacher
for his dedicated service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Music.
VII. DEATHS
Secretary Kennedy reported to the Regents the death of
Stephen C. A. Paraskevopoulos, Professor of Architecture. The
following memorial statement was adopted.
S. C. A.     The Regents of the University acknowledge with great sadness the
Paraskevopoulos  death of STEPHEN C. A. PARASKEVOPOULOS, professor and director
Memorial
Statement of the Architectural Research Laboratory who died suddenly May 7, in
Athens, Greece.
Born May 21, 1926, Professor Paraskevopoulos received a Diploma in
Architectural Engineering in 1951 from the National Technical University
of Athens, and the Master of Architecture degree from The University of
Michigan in 1954.
Before coming to the United States for his graduate studies, he was a
self-employed architect in Athens for four years. He had also served in the
Greek Air Force from 1948-49 and was liaison officer between the Greek
and U.S. Air Forces from 1951-53. In addition to serving as director of the
U-M Architecture Research Laboratory since 1972, Professor Paraskevo



MAY MEETING, 1976


313


poulos served as chairman of the University's doctoral program in architecture since 1971.
Professor Paraskevopoulas was one of the most versatile scholars and
researchers of the architecture faculty. His broad cultural background contributed much to developing in his students a genuine intellectual interest
in the role of the architect in society. He was enthusiastically devoted to
teaching and possessed a range of skills and interests that made him a
rare asset to the staff. The quality and significance of his research and his
breadth of understanding marked him as one of the most valuable members
of the College of Architecture.
The Regents now join his colleagues and students in expressing their
sincere sorrow at the loss of so dedicated an individual and convey to his
family their deepest and heartfelt sympathies.

Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.

Investment
Review Report


The Regents received a report on Temporary Investments.
The Regents received a six-month investment review and
approved the recommendations for additions to the approved list
of common stock.


The Regents also discussed individual company performance
with investment counsel to insure that appropriate review procedures were being followed.
Real Property  Regent Power moved that the Regents authorize the purchase
of the property at 1324-26 North University Avenue, Ann Arbor,
Michigan. Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
X. OTHER


Michigan Student
Assembly


Vice-President Johnson and Calvin Luker, President of Michigan Student Assembly (MSA), discussed the proposed funding for
MSA. They explained that each student would be asked to contribute 75~ per term through a negative check-off system which
would require the student to notify the proper authority if he/she
did not wish to contribute to the organization.
Regent Baker stated that he disapproves this type of funding,
as he did the PIRGIM plan, and therefore, would vote against it.
Regent Roach said that he was not satisfied that this was
voluntary funding. Nevertheless, MSA performed legitimate Uni



MAY MEETING, 1976


315


versity service functions which distinguished it from the PIRGIM
organization. He therefore felt the recommended funding mechanism was proper.
While Regent Laro agreed that there was a difference between
the two organizations, he still opposed the negative check-off
system. He said he would prefer a direct allocation of University
funds.
Regent Nederlander responded that the University would
have to obtain these funds from other sources, perhaps to the
extent of raising tuition. The negative check-off system would provide the student with an option. He could not foresee any other
alternative.
Regent Dunn then moved that approval be given the Michigan Student Assembly to assess each student 75~ per term, using
the negative check-off system. Regent Nederlander seconded the
motion and it was adopted, with Regents Baker and Laro voting
no.
Regent Baker moved that the Flint campus be authorized to
contract with the firm of Johnson, Johnson, and Roy, Incorporated
for working drawings and specifications for limited development of
physical education and recreation facilities on the Court Street site,
and to bid and construct such facilities at a cost not to exceed
$95,000. Regent Laro seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Laro moved that authorization be given to award long
lead time equipment (package #1) and building construction
contracts (package #2) to the low bidders, subject to appropriate
State approvals for the Central Heating and Cooling Plant and
Utility Distribution System at UM-Flint, as recommended in the
revised document. Regent Power seconded the motion and it was
adopted.
Regent Power remarked that the Regents had visited the
Flint campus on Thursday and were pleased with its development.
President Fleming then stated that Committee B's report on
Recombinant DNA Research has been discussed by the Academic
Affairs Advisory Council, the Research Advisory Council, and the
Senate Assembly, and that all endorse the report. The Regents
have had expert and community testimony on the subject in the
form of special meetings and forums at which different points of
view have been expressed. After reviewing this information, the
Executive Officers recommended approval of the report of Committee B and the establishment of review mechanisms.
Regent Roach then moved that the following revised resolution
be approved:

Recreation

Recombinant
DNA Research




316


MAY MEETING, 1976


1. Recommendations of Committee B should be approved; in particular:
(a) Recombinant DNA research should go forward as long as it is
submitted to the controls described below:
(1) The guidelines prepared by the National Institutes of Health
are acceptable basis for insuring the safety of experimentation in molecular genetics and viral oncology. Revised NIH
guidelines shall be reviewed by Committee C as they appear.
(2) Further restrictions for research at The University of
Michigan are recommended as follows:
(i) No experiments requiring containment levels above P-3
shall be permitted without approval of the Board of
Regents.
(ii) EK-2 biological containment will be used when available in all bacterial experiments requiring P-3 physical
containment.
2. The Regents direct that procedures be developed for constant monitoring and safety of the research. In addition, the Regents direct that
periodic appraisal of three review mechanisms be carried out by the
University and reported at least annually to the Board of Regents.
Regent Laro seconded the motion.
Regent Brown indicated that DNA research has been a widely
debated issue. He was pleased with the discussions, but felt that an
effort should be made to invite those who opposed the research but
who were unable to appear before the Board earlier to present their
views. He therefore moved that the issue be tabled until the June
meeting. Regent Dunn seconded the motion. The motion failed,
with Regents Baker, Laro, Nederlander, and Roach voting no.
Regent Power then reviewed the changes made in the original
document. They consisted of the addition to l(a)(1), "Revised
NIH guidelines shall be reviewed by Committee C as they appear;" the revision of l(a)(2)(i) stressing that experiments
requiring containment levels above P-3 shall not be permitted
without approval of the Board of Regents; and the addition to 2:
"...... the review mechanisms be carried out by the University
and reported at least annually to the Board of Regents.
Regents Baker and Laro indicated their approval of the
approach the University had taken to inform the Regents and the
community of the facts of this controversial issue. The benefits
of this research-to the nation, the world, and this Universityshould not be denied.
Regent Dunn indicated that he would vote against the proposal
because the Regents refused to delay their decision a month until
Robert Sinsheimer, a prominent California biologist, could present
his views to the Board. He commented that Dr. Sinsheimer thinks
the research should be delayed until a national policy can be




MAY MEETING, 1976


317


formulated, and that the research should be conducted at only a
few highly specialized laboratories.
Regent Dunn emphasized that he was in favor of the research,
but felt that all sides of the issue should be heard before a decision
was made.
"I think the question of being totally fair is as important as
the issue itself," he said. "A one-month delay would have been
more in line with the traditions of this great university."
Regent Roach stated that two highly regarded experts who
were very articulate in arguing against this research had been on
the forum panel, and that there has been a great deal of correspondence from its critics.
Regent Nederlander commented that no other issue has received as much attention during his term on the Board. He believed that all views have been heard and endorsement has been
received from a great number of sources. There is no doubt of
the substantial benefits possible; the only question is the risk
involved.
President Fleming then asked for a vote for Regent Roach's
motion to approve the above resolution. The motion was adopted,
with Regent Dunn voting no.
The Regents approved two resolutions to be presented at a  Resolutions
later date at The University of Michigan-Flint.            Approved, Flint
The Regents received a report on administrative organization  Administrative
and title changes at The University of Michigan-Dearborn.   Report, Dearborn
The Regents received a report on The University of Michigan
-Flint Citizens Advisory Committee.
President Fleming then commented on the proposal to offer National Solar
University lands as part of the State bid to attract the National Inergy Research
Solar Energy Research Institute to Michigan. It was suggested
that more information should be obtained and that discussion be
deferred to the June meeting.
On recommendation of Vice-President Rhodes, Regent Dunn  David M.
moved that the Physics-Astronomy Building be named the David  Dennison Building
M. Dennison Building. Professor Dennison was a researcher of
international stature and one of the most widely respected members of the University. Regent Brown seconded the motion and
it was adopted.

All of the above transactions were by unanimous vote unless
otherwise indicated.
Transportation expenses and accommodation costs for the
month of April 1976 totaled $3,520.83.

APPENDIX A
HONORARY DEGREES
Characterizations by Harvey Jacobson, James Frenza, and Gilbert Goodwin
Conferred May 1, 1976
DANIEL JOSEPH BOORSTIN, attorney, historian, author, Librarian
of Congress.
The National Observer pronounced you "no ordinary historian, but a
practitioner of social history."
That description implies an authority enlarged beyond traditional
scholarship into the realm of social analysis. The accuracy of the appraisal
is evident in your prize-winning series of books titled The Americans.
With remarkable perception you have shown us in these and other landmark writings how American social and political institutions reflect their
development in a frontier culture, and what their future trends are likely
to be.
Few men have been as well qualified in so many disciplines for intellectual undertaking. Your career is a sequence of challenges met and
mastered: Honors graduate at Harvard, Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, member
of the English bar and one of the few Americans qualified to plead in Her
Mlajesty's High Courts, attorney in the United States after study at Yale,
distinguished teacher of English and American history, literature, and legal
history. You have enlightened a generation of scholars.
Having found you a distinguished keeper of the Smithsonian Institution, our treasured national attic, the country has turned to you now to
direct the Library of Congress, crowning a career already notable for public
service.
The University of Michigan is privileged to entertain so preeminent
a sclolar and to confer upon you the degree Doctor of Letters.
FRAN~OISE GIROUD. Film        maker, journalist, public servant.
Editor, feminist, craftswoman of words. Talker and listener; looker and
thinker. Above all, creator of a life of examination, passion and equilibrium.
Your journalistic career constitutes the highest expression of the
greatest goal of the press: to serve as an instrument of integration and
self-realization to readers caught in a world ever changing, ever strange.
When you edited Elle, it became an entirely new magazine for the new
audience of French women which emerged after the war. You helped found
L'Express, linking a new kind of politics with a new sort of periodical,
offering a vehicle for writing of insight and a platform for statesmanship
of the democratic left. And then, at a later time when television and radio
began to bring more entertainment than information, you edited L'Express
through its transformation into a magazine which succeeded in building
fact and opinion into a structure of comprehensible events.
As Minister for Women in the government of the French Republic,
you now speak for entire generations of women-and men-who realize
that the process of bringing women into a full partnership in our society
is among the most revolutionary developments of all human time.




320


MAY MEETING, 1976


Your accomplishments, Madame Giroud, are facts. They honor themselves.
Today, however, we honor you and the very special style with which
you have woven your contributions to your own country and to the world
into the texture of a life of the mind and the act and the feeling.
It is with the deepest pleasure that The University of Michigan confers
upon you the degree Doctor of Humane Letters.
ISABELLA    LUGOSKI KARLE, Bachelor of Science, 1941; Master
of Science, 1942; Doctor of Philosophy, 1944; research physicist.
It is given to few of us, in any field of human endeavor, to have our
work receive international acclaim and application. Through your dedication and your mastery of material you have experienced the satisfaction of
such recognition for your significant contribution to scientific knowledge
and practice.
You are an acknowledged leader in the field of electron diffraction,
and your work has contributed to the understanding of fundamental
chemistry. Your principal research interest in x-ray crystallography has
resulted in methods of analysis used by scientists all over the world. The
fruit of your research has made possible advances in medical theory and
practice, and has proven beneficial to many other branches of science.
You have shared your findings with students and colleagues as a widely
read author and distinguished lecturer. For your contributions to scientific
knowledge and for your brilliant career, you have been richly honored by
your associates.
Your accomplishments bring honor to The University of Michigan,
which is proud to confer upon you the degree Doctor of Science.
REGENTS' CITATION OF HONOR
FRED BERNARD BEAR, manufacturer of archery equipment.
Your career as manufacturer, sportsman, and conservationist reminds
us that a strong and imperishable link with nature is one of mankind's surest
defenses against the pangs of spiritual isolation.
Your lifestyle has provided the nation with incentive to enjoy outdoor
interests, and your creative imagination has provided superlative equipment
to pursue them. The name Fred Bear has become a living legend, a trademark of excellence.
Bear Archery Company of Grayling rose to world leadership out of the
great tradition of the artisan as cornerstone of civilization. Having admired
the ancient craft of bowyer, you assumed its mantle and brought to your
craft a thorough grasp of modern technology. Reversing the customary order
of historical development, you utilized expertise gained in the manufacture
of automobiles to revolutionize the making of bows and arrows. Your firm
was first to mass produce archery equipment superior in design and workmanship. Yet you have unselfishly shared your designs with others.
A life-long supporter of conservation, actively involved in land and
wildlife preservation, you well deserve your reputation as one of the outstanding sportsmen of this century.
The University of Michigan is proud to acknowledge the great credit
you have brought our state. We take pleasure in presenting to you this
Regents' Citation of Honor.

JUNE MEETING, 1976


Born in Kansas but raised in Oak Park, Illinois, Professor Griffin took
his undergraduate and Masters of Arts degrees at the University of Chicago,
and his doctorate at The University of Michigan as a special degree in
anthropology in 1936. Although he served as visiting professor at the National University of Mexico, University of California, University of Colorado,
University of Copenhagen as a Fulbright Lecturer, Florida State University,
and Louisiana State University, Professor Griffin's entire illustrious professional career was spent at The University of Michigan.
In 1937, he was appointed Assistant Curator of Archaeology in the
Museum of Anthropology, Associate Curator in 1942, and Curator in 1945.
He was appointed Director of the Museum of Anthropology in 1946 and
held that position continuously until 1975. Almost singlehandedly he built
the Museum of Anthropology into an internationally renowned museum
devoted to anthropological research.
Professor Griffin was first accorded a teaching title in the Department
of Anthropology in 1945. He was appointed Professor in 1949. He served
as chairman of the Department of Anthropology from     1972-1975. As a
Professor in the Department he chaired more doctoral committees than
anyone in the history of the Department.
His contribution to the establishment of scientific archaeology in the
United States has been recognized by his professional colleagues. Since
archaeology depends upon an accurate chronology, he pioneered the utilization
of ceramics for dating sites, and later was one of the first to apply radiocarbon dating to perfect these chronologies. Long ago he recognized the
importance of prehistoric trade to explain similarities between cultures, and
once again realized the potential of recent scientific advances such as neutron
activation analysis to solve problems related to cultural contacts. He was
a leader in the application of biological sciences for understanding relations
between prehistoric man and the influences of the natural environment on
his way of life. These successful pursuits won him the Viking Medal and
Award in 1957, the highest honor in anthropology, election to numerous
professional offices, and membership in the prestigious National Academy
of Sciences in 1968. Indiana University awarded him an honorary D.Sc. in
1971.
The University has honored him on several occasions for exemplary
research, steadfast service, and devoted teaching. He received the Russel
Lectureship Award in 1972 and the Distinguished Faculty Achievement
Award in 1976.
The Regents now salute this distinguished archaeologist for his dedicated
service by naming him Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and Curator
Emeritus of Archaeology.
E. Jennings    EDNA JENNINGS, Associate Professor of Nursing, will retire from
Retirement active faculty status as of July 1, 1976 after a most productive career as a

as a staff nurse at Oakway Hospital in Marshall, Michigan from 1931-1942.
She served as a member of the Army Nurse Corps from 1942-1946 and held
the rank of First Lieutenant when discharged. She entered the University
of Minnesota in 1946 and received her B.S. degree in 1948. She served as
a staff nurse at the Calhoun County Health Department in Battle Creek
from 1948-1958. From 1958-1962 she was Assistant Director of Nursing
for the Calhoun County Health Department. She entered the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1962 and received her M.P.H. in 1963.

RAYMOND F. MOSHER, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engi-        R. F. Mosher
neering, has retired from active faculty status as of June 30, 1975, after a  Retirement
very productive career as a teacher.
A native of Massachusetts, Professor Mosher received the S.B. and S.M.
in electrochemical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in 1929 and 1930, respectively.
From 1930-31 he was employed by Bell Telephone Laboratories as a
research electrochemist and from 1931-42 he was employed by Western
Massachusetts Electric Company as an engineer and supervisor. During the
time he was employed by General Electric Company in Pittsfield, Massachusetts (1942-48), his work was varied including war work in the Naval
Gun Director Plant, work on the Manhattan Project, and research and
development in the Electrical Research Section of the Works Laboratory.
He was employed as an associate professor of electrical engineering at the
University of Vermont, and as a visiting professor of electrical engineering
at the Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, before coming
to The University of Michigan in 1957.
In 1959 he effectively helped to re-establish the strength in the electric
power systems phase of the Electrical Engineering Department's educational
program that had suffered a severe loss upon the death of another facuty

JUNE MEETING, 1976


member. He taught a graduate level course in this field in the evening in
order to establish the pattern that these courses can be taken by people
who must take them after working hours since they work outside Ann
Arbor. He was active in planning the electrical engineering courses and
equipment for the Dearborn Branch of The University of Michigan.
He taught in the electric machinery area for many years and then very.uccessfully made the transition to energy conversion. In 1961 he partici-,ated, as a student, in the Ford Foundation Computer Program which was
established to teach teachers how and when to use computers so they might
in turn involve their own students in computing.
He served on several Department and College committees and for several
years served as a freshman counselor. He also served as a faculty adviser
to Eta Kappa Nu and the student branch of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers (AIEE).
He is registered in Massachusetts; is a Senior Member of the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEE); a trustee of the Scholarship
Fund of the Michigan Society of Professional Engineers; and is a member
of the American Society for Engineering Education, the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, the Michigan Standards Society and Eta
Kappa Nu.
In recognition of this distinguished educator and researcher for his
dedicated service the Dean and Executive Committee and the Department of
Electrical and Computer Engineering request the Regents to name Raymond
F. Mosher Professor Emeritus of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
A. G. Norman      Dr. A. GEOFFREY NORMAN, Professor of Botany, is retiring on
Retirement June 30, 1976. He has been a member of the faculty since 1952, and during
that time served for ten years as Director of the Botanical Gardens and
for eight years as Vice-President for Research. He is recognized as an excellent
teacher, researcher, and administrator, and has bought distinction to the
University not only for activities within the University, but for his contributions at the national level.
Dr. Norman was born and educated in England and holds earned doctorate degrees from the University of Birmingham and the University of
London. He came to the United States in 1937 and to The University of
Michigan in 1952. Upon his arrival at the University, he became director of
a major research project in plant nutrition. Two major contributions to his
field are the result of his editing twenty volumes of Advances in Agronomy
and six volumes of Agronomy Monographs.
In addition to teaching, conducting research, and editing major professional publications, Dr. Norman made a significant and long-term contribution to the University by providing the leadership which led to the
selection of a new site and to the development of a new facility for the
University's Botanical Gardens. He established rapport with the donor of
the site and enabled him to see the scientific significance of the site for the
gardens. His skill in planning the gardens, and in working with the federal
agency which provided funds to help pay for the building, resulted in the
orderly development of one of the leading university botanical gardens in
the nation.
As Vice-President for Research from 1964-1972, Dr. Norman was a
most able administrator and guided the growth of research in the University.
During periods of controversy over classified research, he participated
regularly in forums and meetings with students and faculty in order to
provide informed discussion and rational approaches to solving differences.
During periods of increasing financial stringency, he kept the needs of the
research community-both faculty and students-before the University's
Executive Officers and State officials. He used his considerable prestige to
maintain good relations with federal agencies. These activities, which by




JUNE MEETING, 1976


333


their nature often went unnoticed or at least were not widely recognized
by the University community, enabled the University to maintain its composure as well as its stature.
During his administration as Vice-President for Research, Dr. Norman
directed the development of support for the Highway Safety Research Institute, a major research organization supported by the automotive industry
and the Department of Transportation. Rapid development of support from
NASA for civilian applications of remote sensing was also undertaken. He
personally directed the negotiations for establishment of the Institute for
Environmental Quality and served as its first director. He took a keen
interest in strengthening the Computing Center as a resource for instruction
and research, and he provided the leadership which resulted in the Center's
new building. Finally, he strengthened the ties between his office and the
faculty by developing a close working relationship with the Senate Assembly's
Committee on Research Policies. In summary, his tenure as Vice-President
for Research was distinguished and enabled the University to increase its
stature as one of the country's leading universities.
In 1963-65, he was adviser to the President of the National Academy of
Sciences and in the four-year period, 1965-69, he was Chairman of the
Division of Biology and Agriculture of the National Research Council. In
these positions he provided guidance at the highest levels of government for
policies affecting research and its support.
The Regents now salute this distinguished botanist and administrator
for his dedicated service to The University of Michigan by naming him
Professor Emeritus of Botany and Vice-President Emeritus for Research.
HELEN WALTER DODSON PRINCE, Professor of Astronomy, has
retired from active faculty status as of June 30, 1976, after an outstanding
association with the University as a teacher and research worker.
Professor Prince, a native of Baltimore, obtained the degree, A.B., from
Goucher College. She served as statistician with the Maryland Department
of Public Instruction before entering the Graduate School of The University
of Michigan in 1931. She here obtained the A.M. degree in 1932, and the
Ph.D. in Astronomy in 1933.
From 1933 through 1945, she was Assistant Professor of Astronomy at
Wellesley College. A major fraction of the women in graduate astronomy
in the United States during this period obtained their undergraduate instruction from Professor Prince. She spent the summers of 1938 and 1939 as
Research Assistant at the Observatoire de Paris, Section d'Astrophysique at
Meudon, which was then, and is now, a world center for observation and
analysis of solar activity.
During the war years, 1943-45, Professor Prince was a member of the
staff of the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where she contributed to the mathematical development of radar.
At the end of the war, she was called to the Professorship in Astronomy
at Goucher, where she served during 1945-50. In order to further her studies
of the sun that had been started at Meudon, she was asked to join the staff
of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory of The University of Michigan in 1947,
at first on a shared-time basis with Goucher. At Michigan she was made
full-time Professor of Astronomy in 1957 and Associate Director of the
McMath-Hulbert Observatory in 1962.
Although she never abandoned teaching in her area of specialization,
it was her imaginative and diligent research activity that has made the
McMath-Hulbert Observatory an internationally recognized source of observations and interpretations of the interactions between he sun and the
earth. In recognition of her outstanding contributions, the University conferred upon her a Faculty Dstinguished Achievement Award in 1974. She
was awarded the degree D.Sc. (honoris causa) by Goucher College, and

School of Business Administration, being named associate professor of Industrial Relations in 1955, and professor of Industrial Relations in 1957.
In addition to his work at the University, Professor Ryder is an attorney
and professional arbitrator of industrial relations disputes. He has also
served as chairman of a number of state and federal commissions appointed
to investigate disputes.
In his years at the University, Professor Ryder demonstrated a remarkable teaching effectiveness, a liking for his work, and a keen interest in his
students, by whom he is well regarded. His technical qualifications and the
respect in which he is held by those acquainted with his work, and his
intimate and thorough knowledge of his field, made him one of the most
valuable members of the staff in the School of Business Administration.
The Regents now salute this distinguished educator by naming him

on Honorary Degrees for the awarding of honorary degrees at the
August 22, 1976 Commencement and for the December 19, 1976
Commencement. They also approved the conferring of five Outstanding Achievements Awards on November 13, 1976, one
Regents' Citation of Honor and one Regents' Resolution.


IX. FINANCE-PROPERTY
Expenditures  The Regents approved Vice-President Pierpont's recommendation for expenditures in 1976-77 at present levels, pending approval and adoption of budgets for 1976-77.
Auditor General  The Regents received a report from the Auditor General for
The University of Michigan-Flint which will be reviewed at a
subsequent meeting of the Regents.
H. F. ebert  An offer to purchase from the University the mineral rights
on 40 acres of land in the Helen F. Weber estate was deferred
until the September meeting.
The Regents authorized the University to obtain appraisals
on certain parcels of land in Alger County, and deferred the offer
to purchase land and easement on the property from the University until the September meeting.
Temporary
Investments  The Regents received a report on Temporary Investments.
National Solar  President Fleming then referred to the proposal to offer UniEnergy Research
Institute versity lands as part of the state bid to attract the National Solar
Energy Research Institute to Michigan which was deferred last
month.
Regent Laro moved that the following resolution be adopted:
In accordance with the discussions which have been held with
the Regents and subject to applicable restrictions and conditions
imposed by the federal government, it is resolved that the
University offer its interest in property described as Tracts A-100
and A in the February 8, 1961 conveyance of said land to the




JUNE MEETING, 1976


337


University, for inclusion in the proposal which the State of
Michigan is submitting to the Federal Energy Research Development Administration for a Solar Energy Research Institute.
Regent Roach seconded the motion.
Regent Laro continued that he felt the Institute would involve
worthwhile research and the state would benefit considerably in
terms of jobs and other economic interest.
Regent Roach commented that the land involved was originally
a grant from the federal government. Therefore, if the proposed
site was elected for the Institute, the transaction would, in fact,
be transferring the property to another public agency
President Fleming explained that the resolution was not an
actual conveyance of the land, but a statement of the University's
willingness to participate in this venture.
President Fleming then asked for a vote. The motion was
approved with Regents Dunn and Nederlander voting no.
X. OTHER
Vice-President Johnson indicated that since the State of Michi- Health Service
gan considers it inappropriate to support the University Health Fee
Service with general funds, a fee would be charged each student
beginning with the Fall 1976 term.
In this connection, Regent Roach said that all fees should be
reviewed at the time the tuition schedule is being considered.
President Fleming agreed, but said that information was not
complete at that time. He said the tuition schedule is announced
as soon as possible in order to inform the students of any change
before they leave campus.
Vice-President Rhodes presented the fee proposal for part-time  Part-time Underundergraduate students. He said it would substantially alleviate graduate Fee
the burden on those students taking less than a full program.
Regent Waters then moved that the new fee model for undergraduate students for implementation in the Fall 1976 term be
approved. Regent Roach seconded the motion and it was adopted.
Regent Power requested that this information receive wide
publicity in the fall so the students will be apprised.
The Regents approved the revision of Bylaw 3.10 to include  Bylaw Sec. 3.10
the ownership of computer software, along with ownership of Revlsed
patents, copyrights, and other property rights as follows:
Sec. 3.10. Ownership of Patents, Copyrights, Computer Software, and Other Property Rights. Unless otherwise provided by

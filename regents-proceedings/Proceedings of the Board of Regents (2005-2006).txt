Call to Order and President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She announced that the women's

having won the national championship, and had represented the University extremely
well. She also commented on her recent visit to China where University ofMichigan
officials formalized partnerships with universities in Beijing and Shanghai, met with
Chinese elected officials and with the American ambassador to China, and atended
alumni receptions.
PresidentColeman reported that in a few days she would be joining Governor
Granholm on a visit to Osaka, Japan, in order to meet with biotechnology compaies as
part of a state overture tointerest Japanese firms in investing in the state, and
particularly the life sciences corridor. The presidents of Michigan State and Wayne
State Universities, as well as representatives from other Michigan institutions, are also
taing part in the trip, as are Executive Vice President Kelch and ProfessorAlan Saltiel,
director of the Life Sciences Institute.
President Coleman noted that Provost Courant would be stepping down as of
August 31, 2005, and commented, "His service to the University during his tenure as
provost has been stellar. He has brought immense knowledge and commitment to the
role, and all of us who work with him respect both his intellect and his 100% dedication
to the University's academic excellence." She called on Regent Newman.
Regents'Resolution in Honor of Paul Courant
Regent Newman called Provost Courant to the podium and read the following
resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michiga  salute and express
their gratitude to Paul N. Courant as he completes his three-year term as
provost and vice president for academic affairs on August 31, 2005, and
returns to the faculty to pursue his interests in research and teaching.
Provost Courant's career at the University of Michigan has been
ideal preparation for his service as the University s chief academic and
budgetay officer. After joining the faculty in 1973 as an assistant



July Meeting, 2005

professor of economics and public policy, he was promoted to associate
professor in 1978 and professor in 1984, and since 1975 he ha been a
faculty assoiate at the Population Studis Center in the Instiute for
Social Research.Prior to assuming the position ofprovost and executive
vice president for academic affairs in 2002, he served as director of the
Institute of Public Policy Studies, chair of the Department of Economics,
and associate provost for academic and budgetary affairs.  His
commitment to f  debate, ca     analysis,nd reasoed discussion is
evident in his scholarship, his teaching, and his leadership in academic
and public poli  discourse.  e is a thoughtfi Ispokespeson for higher
education and a reglar contributor to state, regional, and national
policy discussions on education finance, aation systems, and economic
development.
A deep dedication to academic excellence, ensuring access, and
the preservation of universities as public goods have been the hallmark
of Dr. Courant's tenure as provost. An active advocate, promoter, and
supporter of the rich interdisciplinaly work that grows out of excellence
and diversity, Provost Courant has helped secure the University's
position among the world's leading institutions of higher learning. His
guidance and oversight durin  cult budgeta  times will be r
as one of his foremost contributions to the University's long-term
well-being, and his emphasis on the recruitment and retention of
outstanding faculty and students will serve the Universit well into the
future.
With respect and appreciation, the Regents commend Paul N
Courant for his outstanding service as provost and executive vice
ident for academic      fairs and look forward to his contiue
contributions as a researcher, teacher, and active participant in public
affairs.
A standing ovation followed. Provost Courant thankedthe Regents for keeping as
a priority the University's quality and peformance,and thanked President Coleman for
her leadership and knowledge ofhigher education, and for the confidence she's had in
him and the flexibility she's given him. He also thankedthe academic leadership of the
institution, including the deans, executie officers, and provost's senior staff and said
that eveything we do should serve the academic mission. He also praised staff at all
levels of the University.
Provost Courant thanked the Regents for the recognition, and for the opportunity to
"do this magical work of learning in this magical place as a faculty member, as provost,
and as a faculty member again." Another standing ovation followed.
President's Remarks on the 2005-2006 Budget
President Coleman noted that in FY2004-05 there had been another reduction in state
appropriation, along with artificially restrained tuition, and an another unexpected
mid-year cut. The unprecedented loss of state appropriations over the past several years,
she stated, now threatens to compromise the University's core academic excellence.
Noting that further losses in state support are likely, she said that the proposed 2005-2006
budget focuses on two of the most critical priorities of her administration, preserving the
University's distinctive excellence in the competitive national maetplace, and



July Meeting, 2005

maintaining access to that education in the face of declning state support. The budget
recommendation addresses the decline in state support by recommending increasesin
tuition and financial aid in additionto about $20 million in cuts and reallocations. The
recommended increase for resident undergraduate tuition is 12.3% and for financial aid,
14.5%. She said she is convinced that ths is the most responsible approach to dealing with
the most extraordinary situation occung in the state, and pointedout that the total
increase in finacial aid from allsources will be over 28%.
President Coleman observed that since 2002, the University has lost over $50
million in base appropriations and $21 million in one-time cuts, which is equivalent to
more than $1,500 per student on the Ann Arbor campus. Although these cuts have been
met with significant budget cuts throughout the University, the cumulative effect of the
cuts has been enorous and has had a real impact on the academic environment. She
noted that 400 staff positions and 100 faculty positions have been eliminated, which
have had a direct impact on teaching workload, class sizes, course offerings, and
advising and other support services. The University, she observed, is now at a point
where its long-term strength is beingthreatened.
Over the past several years, she noted, the University has kept its tuition increases
as low as possible, hoping that the state's economic situation would stabilize. Even
including the 2005-06 recommendation, the University of Michigan's average tuition
increases over the past five years are among the lowest in the state and in the Big Ten.
President Coleman noted that the University's M-Pact progrm was founded to ensure
that a University of Michigan education would not be out of reach for students with
financial need. The University offers the most financial aid of any institution in the
state, and financial aid for resident undergraduate students will increase at a geater rate
than the tuition increase, with total grant support for resident undergraduates increasing
over 28%.
Recognizing the commitment made by students and their families to the
University, President Coleman pledged that their investment will continue to be of the
highest value and the education received will be of the highest quality. President
Coleman observed that fundraising is critically important to the University's ability to
sustain its quality, and concluded that as president, her most important obligation is to
ensure that quality continues to be the number one return on our stakeholders'
investment.
Ann Arbor Campus 2005-2006 General Fund Operating Budget and Student
Tuition and Fee Rates
Provost Courant displayed revenue and expenditure figures for the General Fund,
Designated Fund, Auxiliary Activities Fund, and Expendable Restricted Fund for all
campuses. Total revenues for 2005-06 will be $4,612,800,000; total expenditures will be
$4,569,500,000. Turning to the Ann Arbor General Fund budget, he summarized the
guiding principles, which include maintaining the outstanding quality of academic
programs; maintaining access to the University; and undertaking other activities that will
efficiently and effectively manage the use of all University resources in support of the first
two principles. He repeated the University's financial aid policy, which is "to meet the
demonstrated financial need of all of its Michigan resident undergraduate students."



July Meeting, 2005

Provost Courant reviewed the scope of the budget challenge, which includes cost
increases of $48.7 million for continuing operations (utilities, facilities costs, salaries,
benefits, inflation), plus $14.9 million for commients and essential initives (faculty
positions, library acquisitions, and vaious other initiatives), for a total budget challenge
of $63.6 million. The budget challenge will be met with $43.5 million in net new
revenue and $20.1 million in reductions and reallocations.
Provost Courant reviewed the recent history of reductions in state appropriation,
which since FY2002 have totaled $48.9 million in base cuts and $20.8 in one-time
budget cuts. The governor's recommended appropriation for 2005-2006 is $5.9 million
less than the 2004-2005 appropriation. He noted that recent internal budget cuts made
to cope with the budget reductions had totaled $37.5million in FY2004, $19.8 million
in FY2005, and $20.1 million in FY2006. He displayed a chart indicating the inverse
relationship between the amount of state appropriation and the increase in tuition, ad a
graph indicating the steadily reduced portion of General Fund revenue that has been
fnded by state appropriation over the years, from almost 80% in the 1960s to about
26% in 2005-06.
Provost Courant compared the University of Michigan's tuition increase to those
of oter Big Ten institutions and other Michigan public institutions, both of which
reflect the economic conditions of the states in which they reside. He also displayed a
chart indicating that 2005-06 tuition and fees are significantly lower for both residents
ad non-residents at Michigan than at any of its peer prvateinstitutions.
The recommended General Fund revenue and expense budget for 2005-2006 is
$1,220,485,00 based on the governor's 2005-2006 recommended appropriation. He
reiterated that the goal of the General Fund Budget recommendation is that Michigan
continue to be among the world's great universities, able to provide incomparable
education for extraordinary students and to help invent the future. He noted, "We owe it
to our students,our families, and those who support us through gifts, grants, and taxes
to do this work efficiently and economically," and concluded, "Doing this work
brilliantly is what this budget is all about."
President Coleman observed that the two regional campuses have been hit harder
by state appropriations reductions than the Ann Arbor campus because state
appropriations make up a larger proportion of their budgets. The recommended
2005-06 student tuition and fee increases for both the Dearborn and Flint campuses is
11.9%, accompanied by corresponding increases in student financial aid.
Dearborn Campus 2005-2006 General Fund Operating Budget and Student
Tuition and Fee Rates
Chancellor Little stated that it has been very difficult to construct budgets during the
past few years in light of the restraints imposed by reduced state appropriations. He noted
that the Dearborn campus shares the Ann Arbor campus's priority of continuing to assure
the highest level of academic excellence possible, to retain accessibility, and to maintain a
supportive work environment for faculty and staff.
Chancellor Little pointed out that the budget provides additional resources for new
faculty in the School of Management, funds equal to a 25% increase in the amount of
student financial aid, a 2% salary program, and support for assuming full management

July Meeting, 2005

of the Fairlane Center. Given these priorities and in light of the fact that state support
has dropped by 14% over the past 3 years, he was recommending a student tuition and
fee increase of 11.9%, or about $650 per year for a full-time undergraduate student.
Flint Campus 2005-2006 General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and
Fee Rates
Chancellor Mestas commented that the budget process on the Flint campus is very
open, and everyone who so desires has an opportunit to comment. He said that in view
of the state budget situation, the Flint campus is recommending a tuition and fee increase
of about $340 per semester, or 11.9%. Even with the increase, he pointed out, the
UM-Flint will still be one of the most affordable public universities, and one of the best
educational values, in the state.
Chancellor Mestas commented that the state currently provides only slightly more
than one-thirdof the university's budget, down fom two-thirds several years ago. This
dramatic disengagement from public higher education on the part of the state, he noted,
is especially disappointing in that it is occurring not as a result of a policy decision, but
as a result of short-term decisions on a year-by-year basis. He pointed out that over the
past few yeas, the UM-Flint has instituted more than $4 million in budget cuts, which
has resulted in layoffs, elimination of jobs, salary freezes, cutting of funds for academic
programs, reduction in services, and deferred maintenance. These measures cannot be
sustained indefinitely without compromising the educational quality of the institution.
Chancellor Mestas said that the request includes a 3% salary program,  eant to
compensate in part for the lack of any salary program two years ago.
2005-2006 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly, Student Legal
Services, and School/Colege Governments
Vice President Hper noted that MSA provdes an annual financialreport to the
Regents highlighting expenditures made from the Regentally-approved MSA fees, which
indicates that MSA has been a responsible steward of its funding. The fee request
includes an increase of $.50 for Michigan Student Assembly (from $6.69 to $7.19 per
ter), and an increase of $.50 for Student Legal Seices (SLS) (from $5.50 to $6.00 per
term). No fee increase is requested for school and college governments. The increased
fee es   ted will allow both MSA and SLS to meet the demands fortheir services and
programs.
FY 2006 University Health Service Fee
Vice President Harper noted that the University Health Service (UHS) fee allows
students to have unlimited visits, laboratory testing, X-rays, and other services without
additional out-of-pocket costs, and also provides extensive student health educational
programs across campus. Other revenues come from the pharmacy and services to faculty,
staff, and their dependents. The requested US rate increase of 7.4% ($10.17 per term)
will provide funding for inflationary operating increases, expansion of critical
psychological services, and other needs.

July Meeting, 2005

FY 2006 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Operating Budget
Executive Vice President Kelch recognized the work of his leadership te,
including UMHHC director and CEO Larry Warren, Senior Associate Hospital Director
and COO Tony Denton, Medical SchoolDean Allen Lichter, Associate Vice President and
CFO Doug Strong and his associate, Kathleen Moore. He announced that FY2005 was
the fourth consecutive year of operating margin iprovement, wi an expected margin of
5.1% in FY2005. He noted that the UMHC continues to experience high demand for its
services, and staff and faculty are performing at remarkably high levels.
Dr. Kelch said that positive margins are essential for the future health and
well-being of the Health System, and positive margins are achieved tough focusing on
a combination of activity levels, revenue per case, expense per case, and available
capacity. To maintain the required operating margins,the emphasis during FY2006 and
FY2007 will focus on expense management, due to payer concerns and pressure on
capacity.
Dr. Kelch said the UMHHC is forecasting an increase in the number of discharges
and outpatient cases for the coming year. He described how the institution has
increased inpatient capacity during the past three years and how it intends to maage
inpatient growth in the coming years. He reported that the UMHC is forecasting a 4%
operating magin for FY2006, with an 8.2% increasein total operating revenue
calculated mostly on the basis of increased activity rather than on increases in revenue
per case. Because expenses are increasing at a higher rate than revenues, a lower
operating margin is forecast for FY2006 than for FY2007.
Dr. Kelch described the areas of risk affecting the Health Center's ability to
achieve its budget goals for FY2006 as well as plans for mitigating these risks. He
reportedthat the senior leadership would focus on maxmizing throughput within
existing capacity, would implement best practice measurement models along with "lean
management" techniques, would continue to engage the organizationaround efforts
required to achieve margin objectives, and would keep the Board informed of
opportunities to increase capacity for long-term groth. He concluded that this is an
assertive, but achievable budget that would put more focus on expense management
than in the recent past, and requested approval.
FY 2006 Athletic Department Budget
President Coleman called on Athletic Director Bill Martin to present the FY2006
Athletic Deparment budget. Mr. Martin thanked Provost Courant for his supportof the
Athletic Department  ng his term as provost.
Mr. Martin reported that with the help of the priority seating program, the
department has achieved a stable economic model, which has been his number one
priority since assuming the position of athletic director. Two new buildings, the
Academic Center and the Events Center, have achieved their funding goals and will be
completed on time and within budget. Fundraising efforts are continuing for other
capital projects, and studies are being undertaken about renovations to Michigan
Stadium.

July Meeting, 2005

Mr. Martin reviewed the status of the Preferred Seating Program, noting that about
93% of season ticket holders in seats subject to the donation chose to pay the donation.
He reported that the Preferred Seating Program has yielded more than $4 million in base
donations and $1.3 million in additional, voluntary donations, and that the departent
has received more than $6 million as a result of the proam. The department's
projected revenues for FY 2004-05 are $75 million, a 10.9% increase over the previous
year, with expenses projected to be $61.5 million. He pointed out that there has been a
budget surplus for each of the past three years. For FY 2005-06 the revenue projection
is $73.3 million, with projected expenses of $63.9 million, leading to another surplus.
He reviewed key questions affecting projections beyond FY2006, as well as
facilities priorities and challenges. Mr. Martin commented that the department has
about $50 millionn reserves, up from about $30 million several years ago, andthat the
department has a relatively modest level of debt, about $6 million.
General Comments - 2005-2006 Revenue and Expenditure Operating Budgets
Executive Vice President Slottow commented on the University's balance sheet,
noting that it is subject to sustained, focused manaement," and that te physical,
financial, and human assets across the University are being very carefully maintained. He
said he has reviewed in detail all of the proposed 2005-06 budgets, and praised the qualit
of the work of staff members who developed the budgets. He also praised Provost
Courant and his tenure as provost, noting, "He has been a great colleague and fiend,
professional and classy. He leaves the University beter academically, bettr financially,
and better physically than it was when he took over this post."
Finally, Mr. Slottow acknowledged the efforts ofstaff at all levels who have led
the effort to provide a higher level of service for a lower base budget throughout the
University.
Comments About Proposed Budgets
Regent Richner noted that the budgets for thethreecampuses are all based on the
governor's recommended budget allocation, even though the legislature has not yet come
to an agreement. He asked what the response would be if the final recommendaon
differs from the one on which the University's proposed budgets are based.
President Coleman responded that Vice President Wilbanks has been closely
following the budget negotiations in the legislature and asked her to comment. Vice
President Wilbanks noted that the state is entering its fourth year of declining higher
education appropriations. She pointed out that in previous years, universities had
agreed to moderate tuition increases in exchange for receiving flat appropriations, only
to have those appropriations cut a few months after the agreement. The assumptions
underlying this year's budget recommendations are based on expectations that the
appropriations for 2005-06 will be very similar to those of the previous year. Thus, the
presumed Ann Arbor Campus appropriation of $314 million is based on sound, prudent
reasoning.
President Coleman stated that even if the final appropriation from the state is
higher or lower than the estimated $314 million on which the budget is based, the
University would not return to the Board and request an djustment to the tuition rate.

7



July Meeting, 2005

She said that contingencies are in place for dealing with a final appropriation that is
either substantially less or more than the expected $314 million. If the amount is less,
adjustments would be made, and if it is more, that would have a bearing on next year's
budget.
Provost Courant said that even after the final appropriation is approved, the
University cannot be certain of the actual amount that will be delivered until the end of
the fiscal yea. Regent Richner stated that if the final appropriationdiffers significantly,
he would like the budget to be returned to the Regents for reconsideration.
President Coleman cautioned that even if the state were to decide on a substantially
higher final figure, there is no guarantee that these funds would not be cut later in the
year. If an increase in the base budget is approved, that would have an impact on the
budget recommendations for the following year.
Regent Richner said thatordinarily, the legislature would haveadopted a budget by
the time the University sets its tuition rate, but Regent White pointed out that this has
not been the case in recent years. President Coleman responded that even if this were a
unique situation, she would still recommend against Regent Richner's request to
reconsider after the final appropiation is approved.
Regent Deitch stated that he strongly supports President Coleman's opinion on this
matter. He notedthat the Regents have had discussions among themselves about their
constitutional obligations and stewardship responsibility, and the most important
considerations for all stakeholders are certainty and stability. He pointed out that the
Board has taken different approaches to coping with declining appropriations over the
past several years, including holding the tuition increase to 2.8%. However, he is
convinced that the University has done a good job with restrained resources, and has
now come up with a budget that "allows Michigan to remain great." In order for the
appropriations situation to change, he said that the legislaure and citizens will have to
come to the consensus that higher education is truly an important priority. So this year's
approach is the best one when viewed in terms of stability, certainty, and a continuum.
He urged the Board to adopt the budget and to resist reconsidering it until next year.
Regent Brandon suggested that in a period of uncertainty, the more certainty the
Board can bringto thesituation, the better. He noted that it is actually very unusual for
any enterpriseto be able to forecast revenues exactly, especially with a budget thislarge
where there will always be some risk. He agrees with the current approach, he said,
because "we have made the best assumption we can, and if we are the beneficiaries of
bad news ad we get less money we are going to flex costs to reflect that reality. And if
we're the beneficiaries of a pleasant surprise, thatputs us in a better position as we enter
next year, and I don't think that's a very bad place for us to be." He commented that a
clear statement is being made to the community that the tuition decision is one they can
count on, as opposed to having a secondary discussion that would take place at some
point in the future.



July Meeting, 2005

Ann Arbor Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee
Rates
Regent Taylor moved approval of the nn Arbor Campus General Fund operating
budget and student tuition and fee rates, as descrbed in the Regents Communication.
RegentWhite seconded the motion.
Regent Richner suggested that if the final appropriation is an increase over the
expected amount, the budget be reconsidered in September and perhaps a reserve be set
aside for future budget uncertainties in order to prevent a dramatic increase in the future.
The objective should be to provide some consistency in the future.
Regent Newman commented that the discussion has highlighted the importance of
the state appropriation to the tuition process, and how that impacts every decision that is
made. The tuition is reasonable in that it lets the legislature and state residents who are
paying tuition see how these two figures are tied together  While she undestands
Regent Richner's suggestion, she supports the majority of the board who would rather
move forward.
President Coleman reiterated that if the state approves a higher appropriation, that
would be a factor in developing next year's budget, as it always is. Shenoted that the
University has always recognized the strong relationship betweentuition and state
appropriation, and the recommended tuition increases would be moderated in the face of
an increased appropriation for the next fiscal year.
Regent White commented that she looks forward to the day when the state gives
the University more money than it has budgeted for, as suggested by Regent Richner.
Regent Newman noted that last year the state had imposed limits on tuition
increases but could not impose limits on cost increases, and these continue to go up.
The current situation, she said, is the result of the state's intervention in tuition-setting.
"We are making up for what happened last year, this year," she said, "to bring this
institution where it needs to be." Regent Newman said she considered very seriously
not voting for the proposed tuition increase, but believes that the provost proved
convincingly that while there have been costincreases, there have also been significant
cost cuts and cost containment.
Regent Newman observed that this is the fourth straightyear of a downward trend
in the state appropriation, and it is not a responsible stance to merely hope that the
situation will improve. She suggested that the University leadership look at how the
General Fund is funded, as this is the fund that is impacted by state appropriation and
tuition and fees. "If we don't start setting aside money to build an endowment to fnd
the General Fund, or doing things that move us away from the General Fund by
endowing more programs and moving them outside the General Fund, we will do this
every year," she said. "Every time the state does not give us as much money as we think
we need, we are going to raise tuition; there is no way around it. Unless we take some
responsibility for this and determine how we plan to solve this problem as we go
forward, we are going to have this same discussion." Regent Newman said she would
not continue to support tuition increases unless she sees measures being undertaken to
decrease the reliance on state appropriations for funding the General Fund.

July Meeting, 2005

The vote was then taken on the motion to approve the Ann Arbor Campus General
Fund budget and tuition and fee rates and it was approved unanimously.
Dearborn Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee
Rates
Regent Brandon moved approval of the Dearborn Campus General Fund operating
budget and student tuition and fee rates as described in the Regents Communications.
Regent White seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Flint Campus General Fund Operating Budget and Student Tuition and Fee Rates
Regent White moved approval of the Flint Campus General Fund operating budget
and student tuition and fee rates, as described in the Regents Communications. Regent
Brandon seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
2005-2006 Fee Assessments for Michigan Student Assembly, Student Legal
Services, and School/College Governments
Regent Deitch moved approval of the following fees for 2005-2006: $7.19 per
student per term for Michigan Student Assembly, $6.00 per student per term for Student
Legal Services, and $1.50 per term for school and college governments. Regent  hite
seconded the motion. It was pointed out that these figres represent a total increase in
student fees of $1.00 per student per term.
Regent Newman stated that she would be voting against this proposal on the
grounds that student organizations need toconstrain costs, use resources more
effectively, and raise money just as other units need to do. Regent Rchner commented
that he supports the Student Legal Services fee increase but not the increase for MSA.
The vote was then taken and the motion was approved, with Regent Deitch,
Maynard, Taylor, and White in favorand Regents Brandon, Newman, and Richner
opposed.
FY 2006 University Health Service Fee
Regent Deitch moved approval of the proposed 7.4% increase ($10.17 per student
per term) in the University Health Service Fee. Regent White seconded the motion, and
it was approved unanimously.
FY 2006 University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers Operating Budget
Regent Taylor moved approval of the FY2006 University of Michigan Hospitals
and Health Centers (UMHHC) operating budget, as described in the Regents
Communication. Regent White seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.
Further Comments about the Budget
President Coleman thanked the Board for their support of the budget requests,
especially in light of the very difficult circumstances they were presented with.
Regent Taylor commented that nobody takes any joy in increasing the price of
education, but said that it i iimportant to put tis action into the context of the value
being offered by the University to resident undergraduates. He believes that the rate of
about $9,200 per year constitutes one of the best buys in the United States. In terms of
the market, he said, it is "an absolute bargain," and in absolute terms, he said, "it is an

10



July Meeting, 2005

extremely good buy." He noted that premier private K-12 schools cost far more than
attending the University of Michigan.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning and considered four agenda items. As part of its study
of risk management issues, the committee met with Dr. Robert Todd and Ms. Judith
Nowak, associate vice presidents for research, and Carol Senneff, executive director of
University audits, for a briefing about research compliance. The second agenda item
involved a review of human resource metrics with Laurita Thomas, associate vice
president and chief human resource officer, to begin to gain a greater nderstanding of
trends associated with those important cost elements of the University. The commitee
next conducted the first annual review of the University's lease portfolio, meeting with
Associate Vice President Hank Baer and Mary Krasny, assistant director of plant
extension, real estate, and support services. Lastly, the committee received a bimonthly
update of internal audits, with Carol Senneff and Paul Millis, manager of IT Audits.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor reported
that the committee had spent the majority of its session discussing internal affairs of the
committee, developing a list of topics that are within the jurisdiction of the committee
and preparing a preliminary calendar for the next 18 months. These items are still being
vetted within the administration, and will be finalized at the September meeting. The
committee also received a report from President Coleman on the status of ongoing
searches and various other personnel matters.
The Regents then turned to the remainder of the consent agenda.

July Meeting, 2005

University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas reported on a recent visit to the
campus by MSA president Jesse Levine. He also expressed his personal appreciation
and that of the UM-Flint community for Paul Courant's work as provost of the Ann
Arbor campus.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Jesse Levine, president of MSA, noted that
he had received a geat deal of positive feedback about the work being done by MSA.
He reported that MSA's mission is to improve the campus community and significantly

psychological grounding of race and raciaization, a concept with far-reaching
significance.
Professor Hirschfeld's publications have helped  ame the rlationship between
innately specified constraints on cognition and culturally and historically specific
categories in a way that does justice to both. His landmark book, Race in the  aking,
made a major contribution to understanding the ways young children conceive of race
and their ntealization of racial and ethnic prejudice, and his reseach on theculture of
children is a simultaneous challenge to anthropology (in seeing children as active
shapers of the transmission of cultural and social forms) and psychology (in seeing
cultural, social, and organizational dimensions to developmental processes). Based on
his work, Professor Hirschfeld calls for ethnography of children's culture as a step
toward understanding the ways in which culture and cognition interact in development.
The Regents salute thisdistinished scholar by naming Lawrence A. Hirschfeld
professor emeritus of anthropology and professor emeritus of psychology.

of borehole temperature profiles in North and South America and Africa and culminated
in a compilation and analysis of over 24,000 heat flow measurements taken over 60% of
the world in both continental and oceanic terrains. The analysis provided a global
picture of the spatial variations in heat flow at the surface of Earth's crst and was
relevant to a wide range of geological disciplines. As chair of the International Heat
Flow Commission between 1991-95, Professor Pollack was influential in directing
much of the geothermal community toward a new        field of study, borehole
paleoclimatology, that uses temperatures from terrestrial boreholes to reconstruct
historical climate changes. His work in this new area has helped characterize the many
dynamic processes that couple the atmosphere and continental sufce and has provided
importantnew evidence in ongoing attempts to characterize past and present global
climate change.

SEPTEMBER MEETING, 2005

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
September 15, 2005
The Regents convened at 2:35 p.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, Taylor,
and White. Also present were Vice President Churchill, Interim Provost Gramlich, Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor
Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order and welcomed Coach Carol
Hutchins and the national champion Michigan softball team to the meeting. She noted
that everyone had been captivated by the team's success and teamwork, and said that
numerous people have told her how much they enjoyed watching the championship
series on television. She called on Regent Newman.
Regents' Resolution in Honor of Softball Team
Regent Newman called Coach Hutchins and the softball team to the podium and
read the following resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan applaud the Michigan
Wolverines softball team for winning Michigan's first-ever national
softball championship on June 8, 2005, at the Women's College World
Series.
The Wolverines are indeed champions of the west - and east,
north and south. In a thrilling, 10-inning victory against two-time
defending champions UCLA, the Wolverines, who had earned the team's
first-ever number one national ranking, became the first team east of the
Mississippi to claim the national softball championship and only the
second Michigan women's team   to win a national crown.    The
Wolverines also are the first Big Ten team to win a national title in
softball or baseball since 1966.
Much credit goes to Coach Carol Hutchins, who is beginning her
22nd season as head softball coach and is the most victorious coach in
Michigan history, with 940 victories to her credit. As one of the top ten
NCAA Division I active coaches in career wins and winning percentage,
"Hutch" has built the Michigan team into one of the elite programs in
the nation. Under her guidance, the Wolverines have claimed 10 of the
last 14 Big Ten championships and have advanced to the NCAA
Women's College World Series eight times. Hutchins' players have won
numerous all-conference, all-America and individual collegiate athlete
awards, along with 72 Academic All-Big Ten awards, including six from
this year's championship team.

39



September Meeting, 2005

With great pride, the Regents salute Michigan's national
championship women's softball team, along with Coach Carol Hutchins
and staff Bonnie Tholl, Jennifer Brundage, and Jennifer Teague, for
their history-making championship season. They are conquering heroes
and valiant victors all.
A round of applause followed, and a team member presented President Coleman
with a personalized softball jersey. Coach Hutchins responded that it was an honor for
the team to be here, and said, "We felt it only fitting that the president of the United
States and the president of the University of Michigan should get a jersey from the
national champions." She said the team has made everyone proud, and though they've
been successful on the field, "They are most successful every day that they walk on this
campus."
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman welcomed Interim Provost Edward Gramlich to the Regents'
Meeting. She also commended the University community for its outpouring of support
following Hurricane Katrina. She noted that 50 undergraduate students and about 12
graduate students from the affected areas had been admitted as non-degree students for
the fall term.
President Coleman reported that an agreement had been reached in the state
legislature on the FY2005-06 budget. The base appropriation for the Ann Arbor
campus will be $4.3 million less than that enacted in the previous fiscal year. She
expressed the hope that in the coming year there will be progress toward the goal of
achieving a more predictable, robust level of support in future years.
President Coleman also called attention to three projects that the Regents will be
acting on at this meeting: renovations to Mosher-Jordan Hall, the Hill Dining Center,
and renovations to Bursley Hall, all of which are part of the Residential Life Initiative
(RLI). Each project helps achieve the goal of providing student residential space that
connects more seamlessly with students' learning environment and enhances the overall
quality of student life.
South Campus Master Plan Update
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that an update would be presented
of a plan that was last reviewed by the Board in June 2003. He pointed out that master
plans need to be updated periodically to be certain they are aligned with changes in
priorities and plans for major buildings. Two projects that had been outlined at the time
of the last update -- softball and baseball field renovations -- have changed significantly
from their original conception.
Athletic Director Bill Martin noted that the original objective had been to move
the baseball and softball fields to a different location, but it was determined that not
only was the cost of totally relocating those facilities prohibitive, but coaches, players,
and donors preferred the current location. He said there is a flood plain issue in the
current location that needs to be considered. The updated plan, therefore, calls for the
softball and baseball programs to remain in their current locations with appropriate
renovations to the stadiums. The plan also provides for construction of a multi-purpose
field house along State Street, south of Schembechler Hall.

40



September Meeting, 2005

Mr. Martin commented that the renovations will be funded by philanthropy, noting
that most of the necessary funds for the baseball renovation have been raised, but that
more support is needed for the softball project.
Regent McGowan commented that it appeared that the Fisher Stadium (baseball)
renovation was to be far more extensive than the Alumni Field (softball) renovation.
Mr. Martin responded that the softball practice and locker room facilities were
relatively new, having been built in 1998 with a gift from Donald R. Sheperd. The
major needs for the softball program are larger grandstands and a press box. Fisher
Stadium was originally built in the 1940s and has never been renovated. He also noted
that some of the facilities, such as batting cages, are used by both teams.
Sue Gott, University planner, gave a presentation on the updated South Campus
Master Plan. She reviewed the plan presented in 2003, and noted two of the priorities
listed at that time, the Junge Family Champions Center and the Academic Center, are
now under construction and nearing completion.
Ms. Gott said that a storm water management analysis of the south campus led to
certain design features being incorporated into the Academic Center. Some of the
storm water management regional planning approaches on North Campus and Central
Campus might also be incorporated into the future plans for South Campus as well.
Ms. Gott confirmed Mr. Martin's comment that due to prohibitive costs associated
with the original 2003 plan of relocating the baseball and softball facilities, the 2005
update calls for the programs to remain in their current locations. She pointed out that
these are very appropriate land uses within the flood zone area, and noted there is no
evidence of a game ever having been canceled due to flooding. The only challenge
would be accommodating the loss of approximately 30 parking spaces as a result of the
baseball project.
She indicated the location where the new multipurpose field house will be sited
under the updated master plan, and noted that the proposed location for a new
basketball and wrestling practice facility remains adjacent to Crisler Arena, as
originally envisioned in the 2003 master plan.
Ms. Gott indicated that several additional Athletic Department fundraising
priorities have come forward since 2003, including improvements associated with the
football stadium; construction of a new artificial turf practice field which would be
required by the proposed location of the new multi-purpose field house at the site of the
current practice field; and renovation of the historic Marie Hartwig Building. She
displayed the University Planner's Office framework plan for incorporating flexibility
for potential future parking decks, pedestrian linkages and pathways, and regional
utility planning into all of the projects.  Ms. Gott noted that there are several
development zones in the South State Street area that remain available for potential
future development.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee, consisting of him and Regents White and McGowan, had met that morning.
The main topic was a review of the Fiscal Year 2005 external audit results, including a
general overview of the University's financial performance. Also in attendance at the

41



September Meeting, 2005

meeting were Executive Vice President Slottow, Associate Vice President Peggy
Norgren, University Controller Cheryl Soper, Executive Director of University Audits
Cheryl Soper, and three representatives from the University's external audit firm of
Price WaterhouseCoopers (PWC). The external auditors presented a clean, unqualified
report of the University's financial condition. During a private session between the
PWC representatives and the committee, the committee received extremely positive
feedback with respect to the competence, excellence, and professionalism of University
staff. He noted that despite the fiscal challenges the University faces, the committee
was pleased at the highly successful results of the University's fundraising efforts to
date.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor reported
that the committee, which includes himself and Regents Deitch and Richner, had met
with President Coleman regarding the evaluation procedures she uses for the executive
officers. The committee had also received a status report from the Provost Search
Committee, and reports about the progress being made by the several dean search
committees. All are on track for meeting their deadlines. He noted that the majority of
the committee's time was spent reviewing and confirming the 2005-06 committee
calendar. Although the calendar is always subject to change, a yearly schedule of topics
has been established.
President's Salary. Regent Taylor also announced that the committee had been
leading the Board's annual evaluation of the performance of the president. He noted
that President Coleman is beginning the fourth year of a five-year contract. At her
request, she had received no salary increase at the end of her first year, and in year two
she had received a 2% increase. For year three, based on an analysis of the evaluations
of individual board members, the committee is recommending an increase in
compensation of 3.5%.
Regent Taylor stated that the recommendation is based on the Board's recognition
of President Coleman's many strengths and accomplishments during the past year.
Among these are her remarkable leadership in the Michigan Difference campaign and
her equally remarkable and generous personal gift of $500,000 to that campaign; the
healthy financial condition of the University of Michigan Health System in contrast to
that of most other academic medical centers; the establishment of the M-PACT
financial aid program; progress toward her four Presidential Initiatives; her successful
efforts in retaining key faculty; and her leadership in steering the University through
very challenging budget cycles. He also noted that the Regents have been highly
appreciative of President Coleman's passionate advocacy for maintaining the academic
excellence of the University.
Regent Taylor commented that the Regents acknowledge the University's fiscal
situation believe the increase is both prudent and fair. "This compensation figure
reflects our collective confidence in the direction and health of the University and
President Coleman's strong leadership," he said, "while at the same time being
cognizant of the very real fiscal constraints across the campus."
Accordingly, Regent Taylor moved that the president's salary be increased by
3.5%, effective with the academic year which commenced on September 1, 2005, and

42



September Meeting, 2005

concludes on August 31, 2006. Regent Brandon seconded the motion, and it was
approved unanimously.
President Coleman commented, "I'd like to make the point that nobody
accomplishes all this without this team of people sitting around the table. And I
absolutely believe I'm the most fortunate university president in the United States to
have the colleagues that I have and to have the people on the Board who care so
passionately about the University. So I thank you very, very much and look forward to
an exciting, fabulous year coming up."
The Regents then turned to the remainder of the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of July 21, 2005.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the
Plant Extension Report, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report.
With respect to the Plant Extension Report, he noted that the University continues to
make regular infrastructure improvements on existing buildings in addition to
constructing new buildings. He also described the "Voices of the Staff' program
established by President Coleman and administered by Associate Vice President Laurita
Thomas.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report. The Regents received the report of projects established, July 1
- August 31, 2005.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Kelch had no
additional report.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper announced that the new
school year was off to a successful start. She also commented about the three projects
being brought forward today that are part of the Residential Life Initiative (RLI), noting
that the quality of the residential experience makes a significant contribution towards
students' academic success. She pointed out that more than $25 million has been spent
since 2001 on life safety projects, and two additional projects are on today's agenda for
Oxford and Bursley residence halls. Additional projects are being brought forward for
the upgrading of the dining facilities and additional programming and social space
within Bursley Hall, and for a major project providing for the renovation of MosherJordan Hall and construction of an adjacent Hill Dining Center. She pointed out that
the Mosher-Jordan renovation project will be the first major residence hall renovation in
the University's history and is important to preserve and enhance this historic structure.
Vice President Harper commented that the Hill Dining Center will be the first of
its type on campus and enables the University to address more comprehensively the
dining experience and its contribution to community-building efforts and to increasing
the University's ability to support healthy lifestyles. Consolidating the dining
operations will provide operational efficiencies that contribute to the unit's long-term

43



September Meeting, 2005

financial health. The cost of all three projects is included within the original RLI
budget estimates provided to the Board.
University of Michigan-Flint.   Chancellor Mestas introduced the three
individuals being recommended for appointment as vice chancellors on the Flint
campus: Jack Kay, provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs and professor of
communication, with tenure; Mary Jo Sekelsky, vice chancellor for student services and
enrollment management; and Kristen Dahlen Skivington, vice chancellor for
institutional advancement. Chancellor Mestas reported that overall enrollment on the
Flint Campus has increased by 4%, with graduate enrollment having increased by 32%
during the past year. New freshman enrollment has increased by 5%.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little noted that enrollment
growth is the number one priority on the Dearborn campus, and that enrollment for the
freshman class is up by about 20%. Chancellor Little also reported on progress that has
been made on the Greenways Trail along the Rouge River watershed, a portion of
which has been laid on the Dearborn Campus.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. Jesse Levine, president of MSA, reported
on activities of MSA during the start of the school year. He also noted that MSA has
initiated a fundraising campaign for the MSA organization. On behalf of the Residence
Hall Association, he expressed support for the proposed Hill Dining Center and
Mosher-Jordan renovations.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted Reports of Voluntary Support
for June, July, and August, 2005.
Michigan Difference Campaign Update. Vice President May gave an update on
the Michigan Difference Campaign as of June 30, 2005. He noted that as of that date,
more than $1.83 billion had been raised toward the $2.5 billion goal, which is 73%. He
reported that cash receipts had increased by 21% over the previous year's total, and
were the highest ever at the University. Campaign production for FY 2005 added more
than $492 million to the campaign total, which is also a record. He noted that of the
more than 264,000 gifts to the Michigan Difference campaign, 262,000 have been under
$100,000, and the majority of those have been under $5,000.
Vice President May reported that of the $1.5 billion that has been committed
toward the cash goal of $2.1 billion, 75% of these funds are from individuals. This
means that the University of Michigan is one of the leading universities in the country
in the percent of giving from individuals. He also pointed out, however, that many
campaign goals have not yet been met, including $180 million for buildings, $240
million for faculty support, and $120 million for student aid. About $280 million is still
needed to reach the goal for endowment.
President Coleman thanked Vice President May and his team for all of their efforts
that have helped the campaign to reach its current level of success. She also thanked
the donors, noting that given the long-term trends in state support, philanthropy is more
important now than it has been in the past, and it crucial to helping the University
maintain its competitive edge.

September Meeting, 2005

careers of the five medical school faculty members who are retiring: Stanley Berent,
Kenneth L. Casey, Bertram Pitt, Robert H. Bartlett, and Jeoffrey K. Stross.
Robert H. Bartlett, M.D., professor of surgery in the Medical School, retired
from active faculty status on June 30, 2005, after a most productive career.
Dr. Bartlett received his B.A. degree from Albion College in 1960 and his M.D.
degree from the University of Michigan in 1963. He completed his residency training at
Peter Bent Brigham Hospital from 1963-69, and was a National Institutes of Health
trainee in academic surgery at Harvard Medical School from 1969-70. From 1970-80,
he was on the faculty at the University of California-Irvine. Dr. Bartlett joined the
University of Michigan faculty in 1980 as professor of surgery in the sections of general
and thoracic surgery, and he served as director of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit,
director of graduate education, and chief of the Trauma Burn/Critical Care Division.
Dr. Bartlett is best known for the development of extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation, a modified heart-lung machine used for patients with acute heart or lung
failure that has dramatically improved the survival rate for infants, children, and adults
with this condition. His talents as an extraordinary investigator have been recognized
throughout his career. He received 26 research grants, including 14 from the National
Institutes of Health, served on the editorial boards of ten major medical journals, and
wrote more than 300 articles in peer-reviewed publications. Within the University, Dr.
Bartlett developed the Extracorpeal Life Support Program and a surgical critical care
fellowship. Through his tutelage, hundreds of general surgery residents and critical care
fellows have developed into leaders in surgery.
For his preeminent contributions, Dr. Bartlett received numerous awards,
including the Sheen Award for Research and the Jacobson Innovation Award from the
American College of Surgeons, the Medal of Special Recognition from the National
Academy of Surgery of France, the Medallion for Scientific Achievement from the
American Surgical Association, and election to the National Academy of Science's
Institute of Medicine. He served as president of the American Society for Artificial
Internal Organs and the International Society for Artificial Organs.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Robert H. Bartlett
professor emeritus of surgery.
Stanley Berent, Ph.D., professor of psychology in the Medical School, the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and the School of Public Health, retired
from active faculty status on June 30, 2005.
Professor Berent received his B.S. degree from Old Dominion University in 1966,
his M.S. degree from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1967, and his Ph.D. degree
from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey in 1971. He completed his clinical
internship and postdoctoral training at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in 1972 and served on
the faculty of Virginia Commonwealth University from 1967-79. He joined the
University of Michigan faculty as an associate professor of psychology in the
Department of Psychiatry in 1979 and was promoted to professor in 1990. He received
additional appointments in the Departments of Psychology (1981), Neurology (1986),
and Environmental and Industrial Health (1994).
A distinguished administrator, Professor Berent created one of the premier
neuropsychology programs in any medical center. He initiated postdoctoral training
programs in psychology and in neuropsychology and served as chief of psychology in
the Department of Psychiatry. Active in faculty affairs, he served as chair of the Senate

80



September Meeting, 2005

Advisory Committee on University Affairs, chair of the Senate Assembly, and presiding
officer of the Faculty Senate. He was also a key leader at the Ann Arbor Veterans
Administration Medical Center, where he initiated and oversaw the development of an
accredited internship program, established a postdoctoral training program, served as
chief of the psychology service, and founded and directed the neuropsychology program.
Professor Berent has received numerous research grants and is the author of over
100 manuscripts, books, and book chapters. His awards include a "Merit Authorship
Award" from the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in
recognition of exemplary service and outstanding contributions to the field of
occupational medicine, and election as a fellow of the American Psychological
Association.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Stanley Berent professor emeritus of psychology.
Kenneth L. Casey, M.D., professor of molecular and integrative physiology and
professor of neurology in the Medical School, retired from active faculty status on August
31, 2005.
Dr. Casey received his B.A. degree from Whitman College in 1957 and his M.D.
degree from the University of Washington in 1961. He served his internship at the New
York Hospital and pursued post-doctoral training in neurophysiology at the National
Institutes of Health and at McGill University. Dr. Casey joined the University of
Michigan faculty as assistant professor of physiology in 1966 and was promoted to
associate professor in 1969. He received an additional appointment as associate professor
of neurology in 1974, and was promoted to professor of neurology and professor of
physiology in 1978. He also served as chief of the neurology service at the Ann Arbor
Veterans Affairs Medical Center from 1980-2002.
Throughout his career, Dr. Casey has contributed greatly to the vitality of the
scholarly, educational, and clinical missions of the University of Michigan. His
distinguished research career focused on central nervous system pain mechanisms, and his
work includes seminal animal experimental studies of central nervous system pain
function, important theoretical work on pain perception and the organization of central
nervous system pain pathways, and groundbreaking human clinical studies of the
functional anatomy of pain systems. He has published over 80 peer-reviewed publications
and over 40 book chapters and edited 3 monographs.
Dr. Casey has an outstanding record of service nationally and internationally as a
journal editor, grant reviewer for the National Institutes of Health, and officer of major
professional organizations. His honors include the John J. Bonica Distinguished
Lectureship and Award from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain
Medicine and the Distinguished Service Award and the Frederick W.L. Kerr Basic
Science Research Award and Lectureship for lifetime achievement in basic science
research from the American Pain Society. In 2002, Pfizer Inc. recognized Dr. Casey's
contributions to neuroscience by endowing the Kenneth L. Casey Lectureship.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Kenneth L. Casey
professor emeritus of molecular and integrative physiology and professor emeritus of
neurology.
Michael S. Flynn, Ph.D., research scientist in the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute, retired from active faculty status on March 15, 2005.

81



September Meeting, 2005

Dr. Flynn received his B.A. degree from the College of the Holy Cross in 1964
and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in
1968 and 1972, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1969 as a
lecturer in sociology and was promoted to assistant professor in 1972. In 1976 he
became a research associate and then senior research associate in the School of
Education, and from 1981-85 he was associate research scientist in the Center for
Japanese Studies. Dr. Flynn left the University in 1985 to join the Industrial
Technology Institute. He returned in 1988 as a research scientist in the University of
Michigan Transportation Research Institute, and was appointed director of the Office
for the Study of Automotive Transportation in 2000.
Dr. Flynn's work on manufacturing cost differences and manufacturer-supplier
relationships for the joint U.S.-Japan automotive study became a critical early alert for
companies in the U.S. industry as they faced stiffened global competition. On a U.S. State
Department funded project for the Chinese automotive industry, Dr. Flynn's research
shaped the parameters of Sino-U.S. automotive relationships. He directed the competitive
assessment of the North American automotive industry for the Automotive Select Panel of
the Free Trade Agreement with Canada, which formed the basis for recommendations to
the president that influenced U.S. automotive trade policies with Canada and Mexico. He
also led a series of projects that focused on important structural changes and tensions
occurring in the automotive industry as traditional domestic manufacturers began to
transfer engineering and research development responsibilities to suppliers and to
rationalize the flow of product along the supply chain. Dr. Flynn, a member of the Society
of Automotive Engineers, has testified before the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of
Representatives, and the U.S. International Trade Commission on various aspects of
industry competitiveness. He authored reports that provided the automotive industry with
early warnings on critical human and organizational challenges, and he regularly
contributes analytic articles to the general news media.
The Board of Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Michael S. Flynn
research scientist emeritus.
William E. Kotowicz, D.D.S, Roy H. Roberts Professor of Dentistry and
professor of dentistry in the School of Dentistry, retired from active faculty status on
August 31, 2005.
Dr. Kotowicz received his D.D.S and M.S. degrees from the University of
Michigan in 1966 and 1968, respectively. He joined the University of Michigan faculty
as an assistant professor in 1969 and was promoted to associate professor in 1971 and
professor in 1974. He was named the Roy H. Roberts Professor of Dentistry in 2004.
A highly-respected administrator, Dr. Kotowicz served the School of Dentistry
as interim dean (1987-89), senior associate dean (1989-95), acting dean (1995-96), and
dean (1997-2003). During this time, he chaired the transition committee that
orchestrated the successful reorganization of the school and initiated and implemented a
successful community-based clinical education model involving the creation of five
new partnerships in communities across the state. He also served on various University
committees, including the Academic Program Group and the Health Sciences Council.
Dr. Kotowicz has been a visiting professor at the University of California-San
Francisco, the University of Zurich, and the Universitat Bern, Switzerland. He is a
diplomate of the American Board of Prosthodontics, a fellow in the Academy of
Prosthodontics, and a member of Omicron Kappa Upsilon and Phi Kappa Phi honorary

82



September Meeting, 2005

societies. He is an active member of the American and International Associations for
Dental Research, the American and Michigan Dental Associations, the Michigan
Society of Prosthodontics, and the American Dental Education Association's Council of

The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Mei-Yu Yu, research associate professor in the School of Nursing, who
died on August 1, 2005, at the age of 61.
Dr. Yu was highly regarded for her work in women's health, cancer screening
promotion, and  international health  promotion  and  for her leadership in
Asian-American communities. In 1996, she founded the Healthy Asian American
Project (HAAP) to improve the overall health status of Asian Americans and to reduce
health disparities through research, education, and promotion. Under her direction,
HAAP became a tremendous success, with funding and support gained from the
Michigan Department of Community Health, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, and the National Cancer Institute. The
project organized many health promotion and screening events and trained more than
300 lay health advisors and other volunteers to improve access to and utilization of
early cancer screening among Asian Americans. In 2003, Dr. Yu expanded the scope of
HAAP and initiated the International Health Promotion Project to promote the early
detection of breast cancer in China and to link faculty and students at the University of
Michigan with Chinese universities and hospitals. The project funded and organized the
2005 International Symposium on Breast Cancer in Tianjing, China, and sponsored the
training of many Chinese nurses.
Dr. Yu received her M.D. degree from Shanghai First Medical University in
1968 and was a physician in Changsha, China, from 1968-81. She came to the United
States in 1981 to study at the University of Texas at Austin and recieved her Ph.D.
degree in sociology in 1986. After completing her postdoctoral work in 1988, Dr. Yu
joined the University of Michigan faculty, where she introduced numerous research and
teaching projects in the School of Nursing, mentored more than 30 postdoctoral fellows
and graduate and undergraduate students, and received over $2 million in research
grants. She was the author of more than 50 publications, including four book chapters.
Dr. Yu served on the Asian American/Pacific Islander Advisory Council for the Komen
Foundation and as Michigan chair for the National Asian Women's Health
Organization, and was active in numerous other national and local professional and
health awareness organizations.
As we mourn the loss of this distinguished researcher, our condolences go to her
husband, Bo-nan Jiang; her children, Bo and Hao Jing; her son-in-law, Futeh Kao; and
her granddaughters, Camille and Simona Kao.

Mosher-Jordan Hall Renovation and Hill Dining Center
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that this project will be the first major,
deep renovation of this residence hall, which dates back to 1930. He introduced Mr.
Geoffrey Wooding from Goody Clancy & Associates to present the schematic design.
Mr. Wooding displayed site maps and detailed plans for each level of the structure,
including a cross-section of the building that indicates the security features separating
the residence hall private living space from the public, common areas of the dining
facility. He noted that the dining center would be as transparent and light and
unobtrusive as possible in order to respect the historic architecture of the building it
adjoins. The current loading zone will be relocated to a more unobtrusive spot, and the
current dining hall in Mosher-Jordan would become classroom and seminar spaces. He
displayed several renderings of the new dining center, as well as an architectural model.
Mr. Wooding said that the new dining center is intended to service the "Hill"
residence halls of Stockwell, Mosher-Jordan, Alice Lloyd, and Couzens, but any student
would be allowed to use it. It was noted that the other halls will retain a limited food
service capacity for providing off-hours snacks.
Regent Newman commented that the Regents were told there may be some deed
restrictions on a small portion of the land designated for the Hill Dining Center dating
back to the early 1900s, and asked Vice President Krislov if this is cause for concern.
Vice President Krislov responded that there are some very old deed restrictions in the
original grant dating from around 1910. However, the Office of the General Counsel
has analyzed the documents and the law and has concluded that to the extent that deed
restrictions were originally in place at this proposed site, they have been waived many
decades ago by University use and practice. So the general counsel's office is confident

89



September Meeting, 2005

that there are no deed restrictions that would raise legal concerns about this project at
the proposed location.
Mr. Woody responded to questions from Regent McGowan about aesthetic
considerations regarding the exhaust stack on the new building. He noted that
architects are working with engineers on mechanical and architectural means for
addressing this design challenge. In response to a question from Regent Richner about
operational expenses associated with the new facility, Executive Vice President Slottow
emphasized that significant operational efficiencies will be gained through
consolidating the four major hill dining operations into one facility.
Regent Maynard moved approval of the schematic design for the Mosher-Jordan
Hall Renovation and Hill Dining Center Project as presented at the meeting. Regent
Newman seconded the motion, and it was approved unanimously.

Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President Churchill, Interim Provost
Gramlich, Executive Vice President Kelch, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, and
Vice President Wilbanks. Regent McGowan and Vice Presidents Harper, Krislov, and
Ulaby were absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order and thanked Chancellor Mestas
and the Flint Campus community for their warm welcome.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman noted that during the past week the University had hosted a
number of dignitaries: Bill Gates, of Microsoft Corporation; Paul Rusesabagina, who
saved more than 1200 people from genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and was awarded the
University's 2005 Wallenberg Medal; the soprano, Renee Fleming, who performed
Strauss's "Daphne" at Hill Auditorium; and the actress Joan Copeland and producer
Robert Miller, sister and son, respectively, of alumnus and playwright Arthur Miller,
who attended a ceremony naming the Charles R. Walgreen Drama Center and Arthur
Miller Theatre. She also noted that former vice president Al Gore would be delivering
a lecture on campus on Monday.
President Coleman noted that the Flint Campus is celebrating its "Golden
anniversary", and she commended the campus for its contributions to Genesee County,
the state, and the nation. She noted that the strong bonds with the community that are
the hallmark of the campus would continue under the new strategic plan to be presented
by Chancellor Mestas.
Finally, President Coleman called attention to the plans for the Stephen M. Ross
School of Business that were to be presented that day to the Board. The new facility is
designed to support the action-based learning curriculum that is the hallmark of the
school.
Flint Campus Strategic Plan
Chancellor Mestas welcomed the Regents and executive officers to the campus,
and noted also that a number of leaders from the greater Flint community were in
attendance. He then gave a presentation on the University of Michigan-Flint strategic
plan for 2005-2010, entitled "Engaging Minds, Preparing Leaders." He noted that the
plan sets an enrollment goal of 8,000 students by 2010, which is a challenging goal
given the current enrollment of about 6,300.

97



October Meeting, 2005

Chancellor Mestas presented the campus's mission statement:
"The Flint campus of the University of Michigan is a community of
diverse learners and scholars, where students from this region and beyond
prepare for leadership, achievement, and service through interactive instruction
in the arts, sciences, humanities, and professions. Our mission rests on three
pillars: excellence in teaching, learning, and scholarship; student-centeredness;
and engaged citizenship. Our students become leaders in their fields, in their
professions, and in their communities."
Chancellor Mestas expounded on how the strategic plan will fulfill the campus's
mission. He noted that the campus has been a crucial element in the city of Flint since
its founding, providing hope for the future and vitality to the downtown area.
President Coleman complimented Chancellor Mestas on the Flint Campus'
successful efforts at increasing enrollment.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had met that morning with Erik Lundberg, chief investment officer, to
review the outcomes of the University's investments through June 30, 2005. He
reported that the University Investment Pool currently totals $7 billion.  The
endowment fund portion of that pool exceeds $4.9 billion, and the working capital fund
is nearly $1.5 billion. For the year ending June 30, 2005, the Long Term Portfolio
exceeded the University's custom benchmark (14.1%) and the top quartile of University
endowments (13.6%), having achieved a 19.1% annual return. For three years, the
University achieved nearly 15% annualized return compared to the custom benchmark
of 10.5% and 11.7% for the top quartile of university endowments. The University also
beat other benchmarks in its investment performance. Regent Brandon praised Mr.
Lundberg and his staff for their achievements; and a round of applause followed.
Regent Brandon reported that the committee had also met with Associate Vice
President Peggy Norgren, University Controller Cheryl Soper, and Carol Senneff,
executive director of University Audits regarding progress on implementation of
Sarbanes-Oxley compliant audit procedures. The committee then met with Ms. Senneff
to receive the regular bimonthly internal audit update, and met privately with her to
ensure she is receiving the proper level of institutional commitment and support from
management, and she confirmed that this was the case. Finally, the committee received
the Hospitals and Health Centers quarterly report and learned that the HHC is ahead of
budget for the first quarter. The committee also worked on finalizing its schedule and
work plan for 2006.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor reported
that the committee had been updated by the provost and president on all of the ongoing
searches for deans and directors and were updated on the status of the various collective
bargaining agreements that are underway. They were updated by Associate Vice
President Laurita Thomas about the University's new classification initiative. He said
that because the new system represents a huge change in the classification system, it
would be advisable that this topic be presented to the whole board at some point. The

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 3 retiring
faculty members.
Fred L. Bookstein, Ph.D., distinguished senior research scientist in the Institute
of Gerontology, research professor in the Biophysics Research Division, research
professor in biostatistics in the School of Public Health, and adjunct professor in the
College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on July
31, 2005.
Professor Bookstein received his B.S. degree from the University of Michigan in
1966, his M.S. degree from Harvard University in 1971, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1977. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
assistant research scientist in 1977 and was promoted to associate research scientist in
1980, research scientist in 1984, distinguished research scientist in 1989, and

116



October Meeting, 2005

distinguished senior research scientist in 1997. He was appointed research professor in
2003. During his tenure, Professor Bookstein had research appointments in the Center
for Human Growth and Development, the Institute of Gerontology, the Department of
Biostatistics, and the Reproductive Sciences Program, and he held teaching
appointments in a number of departments.
Professor Bookstein, a biometer, statistical scientist, and applied mathematician, is
perhaps best known as the principal creator of morphometrics, a subfield of statistics
that focuses on the measurement of biological shape and shape change. The results of
his work have been applied across many fields, including evolutionary and
developmental biology, paleontology, computer vision, medical imaging, and cognitive
neuroimaging. He has published over 300 books, chapters, articles, and videos, as well
as several software programs.
Among Professor Bookstein's honors are the University's Distinguished Research
Scientist Award (1989) and appointment as a fellow of the Institute for the Humanities
(1992-93) and as an Honors Faculty Fellow in the Honors Program in the College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts (2001-04). In 1998 he was named life associate fellow
of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. He has held visiting and guest appointments at
universities in the United States and abroad.
The Regents now salute this accomplished faculty member by naming Fred L.
Bookstein research professor emeritus and distinguished senior research scientist
emeritus.
Roberta M. Tankanow, clinical associate professor of pharmacy in the College
of Pharmacy and clinical pharmacist in the University of Michigan Hospitals Pharmacy
Services, retired from active faculty status on June 20, 2005.
Professor Tankanow received her B.S. degree from Northeastern University in
1975. She was appointed as a staff pharmacist at the University of Michigan in 1977
and joined the faculty as a clinical instructor in 1981. In 1984, she received her M.S.
degree from Wayne State University and was promoted to clinical assistant professor,
and in 2000 she was promoted to clinical associate professor.
A pioneering pharmacist and faculty member, Professor Tankanow founded the
Investigational Drug Service (IDS) at the University of Michigan Hospitals in 1984,
and today the service is used as a model by many institutions around the country. The
IDS manages all of the University's clinical human trials that involve use of
investigational agents and ensures compliance with appropriate safety and legal
standards. Professor Tankanow initiated and developed all of the original protocols and
standards by which the service operates, and the service has grown from handling fewer
than 50 protocols at a time to managing almost 300 protocols today. In addition, she
developed a validated fee structure, a quality assurance program, and a process for
preparing for protocol audits at IDS, and she served on the Institutional Review Board
and Protocol Review Committee for the Cancer Center.
Nationally recognized as a leader in the field of investigational drug research,
Professor Tankanow was invited to participate in the development of guidelines for
investigational drug service practices through the American Society of Health-System
Pharmacists. She has served as a reviewer for textbooks and articles and as a consultant
for practitioners in the field. In recent years, Professor Tankanow broadened her clinical
interests to include the area of alternative medicine. She has conducted research in
herbal medicine, and participated in the Faculty Scholars Program.

October Meeting, 2005

The Regents now salute this distinguished educator by naming Roberta M.
Tankanow clinical associate professor emerita of pharmacy.
Susan P. Wright, Ph.D., lecturer in the history of science in the Residential
College and research scientist in the Institute for Research on Women and Gender,
retired from active faculty status on May 31, 2005.
Dr. Wright received her B.A. degree from Oxford University in 1961, her M.S.
degree from the University of Michigan in 1963, and her Ph.D. degree from Harvard
University in 1975. She joined the University of Michigan faculty as a lecturer in 1979.
She received an additional appointment as associate research scientist in 1998 and was
promoted to research scientist in 2002.
In the Residential College, Dr. Wright developed the Science, Technology, and
Society Program (STS), and chaired it until 1997. This program integrates science
training with the study of its social and cultural dimensions, including those related to
feminist and non-western perspectives. As chair, Dr. Wright designed a wide range of
courses, recruited numerous faculty, and taught and mentored many students across the
University who have pursued careers related to science, technology, and society within
the fields of law, journalism, medicine, and policy.
Within the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, Dr. Wright's work
focused on rethinking approaches to arms control and disarmament by setting as
primary goals the security of people and their environments. Her expertise lies in the
area of national and international policies guiding the development of biotechnology,
and in 1998-99, she directed a large-scale international project on biological warfare
and disarmament. Her publications include many refereed articles and three books:
Preventing a Biological Arms Race (1990); Molecular Politics. Developing American
and British Regulatory Policyfor Genetic Engineering, 1972-82 (1994); and Biological
Warfare and Disarmament: New Problems/New Perspectives (2002). Dr. Wright's
work has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the Ford Foundation, and she has been
recognized with numerous awards, including the Rockefeller Humanities Fellowship,
the MacArthur Research and Writing Fellowship, and the University of Michigan
Excellence in Education Award.

Stephen M. Ross School of Business Facilities Enhancement Project
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that Bill Pedersen, of Kohn
Pedersen Fox Associates, would be presenting the proposed schematic design for this
project, and Dean Robert Dolan was also present. Executive Vice President Slottow
noted that the construction schedule will depend on achievement of the fundraising goal
that has been set for this project and expressed confidence that this goal will be
achieved as planned. He then called on Mr. Pedersen. Mr. Pedersen displayed a site
map indicating the location of the project, noting that the new construction would total
270,000 square feet. About 180,000 square feet of existing space, comprising the
Business Administration Assembly Hall, William Davidson Hall, and the William A.
Paton Center for Accounting Education and Research would be demolished and
replaced by the new facility. He said that the manner in which the new building is
integrated into the rest of the campus is very important, and the building also needs to
be able to establish linkages between the existing structures and new structures and
create a strong sense of community for the Business School.
Mr. Pedersen displayed a model of the new facility, noting that it would create a
"winter quadrangle" at the heart of the business school campus equivalent to a town
square. He described various features of the structure and noted that it would consist of
different heights along the various streets surrounding the school. There will be a
glass-covered portico at the entrance to the structure and into the atrium, and all of the
remaining buildings of the existing campus, such as the Kresge Library, will be
integrated into the new structure. He displayed a number of renderings of the exterior
and interior of the building, noting that it would be faced with sandstone and terra cotta
and would incorporate a large amount of glass, an auditorium, and a number of other
elements, including a sky gallery.
Regent Richner commented that it is a "spectacular design," and inquired
whether the extensive use of glass would affect operational costs. Mr. Pedersen noted
that all of the energy costs have been carefully considered, and that the natural light
provided by the glass is fundamental to the issues of sustainability and quality of life
provided by the facility. It is also recognized as efficient from the standpoint of energy
usage.
Dean Dolan commented that the building is not only exciting from an
architectural standpoint, but is most exciting in the way it meets the school's unique
programmatic requirements in a very integrated fashion.
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Taylor, the Regents
unanimously approved the schematic design for the Stephen M. Ross School of
Business Facilities Enhancement project as presented.

Coleman and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Vice President Churchill, Interim Provost Gramlich, Vice
President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor
Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice
President Slottow, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent Deitch
was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order and welcomed the members of

2005 North American Solar Car Challenge. She noted that Interim Dean Ronald Gibala
was present, along with two faculty advisors, and called on Regent White to present the
resolution.
Resolution in Honor of Solar Car Team
Regent White called team members to the podium and read the following
resolution:
Regents' Resolution
The Regents of the University of Michigan congratulate the University
of Michigan Solar Car Team for the first-place victory of its car, "Momentum, "
in the 2,500-mile North American Solar Challenge race which began in Austin,
Texas, on July 17 and concluded in Calgary, Alberta, on July 27, 2005. The
victory marks the University's fourth solar car national championship, the most
of any university since competition began in 1990.
The Regents also proudly salute Momentum's impressive third-place
finish among 22 entries in the 2005 World Solar Challenge. This week-long,
3,000-kilometer race, which traverses the Australian continent from Darwin to
Adelaide, concluded on October 2, and included teams from both the academic
and corporate sectors.
Each generation of solar car is the product of two years of non-stop
endeavor by an enterprising, interdisciplinary, student-run team of more than
150 members. The creativity, dedication and sophistication with which the
Solar Car Team manages all aspects of this project-from fundraising, to
engineering, to marketing, to logistics-prove that "The Michigan Difference"
makes all the difference when our students compete with the best and brightest
from around the world.
The Regents take great pride in Team Momentum 's accomplishments in
the 2005 North American and World Solar Challenges and look forward to
further triumphs in the years to come.

125



November Meeting, 2005

Following the resolution, there was a round of applause, and the student team
members introduced themselves. Brian Gilchrest, one of the faculty advisors, thanked
the Regents and administration for creating the environment that allows these kinds of
opportunities to happen, noting that it is very much appreciated.
President's Opening Remarks
President Coleman commented on recent national accolades given to University
faculty and students. She noted that William "Buzz" Alexander, professor of English
Language and Literature, had been named one of four "U.S. Professors of the Year."
She also announced that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers had
awarded the 2006 Edison Medal, considered the Nobel Prize of electronics, to Vice
President Fawwaz Ulaby. President Coleman reported that 29 University of Michigan
students had been awarded Fulbright Fellowships for 2005-06, the most of any other
U.S. University. She noted that Regent White is a former Fulbright scholar who
currently serves on the board of directors of the Fulbright Association and is its
incoming vice president.
President Coleman concluded by announcing the establishment of a new initiative
focusing on environmental sustainability, made possible by a $5.25 million gift from
the Graham Foundation, which was founded by alumni Donald and Ingrid Graham.
Annual Report of the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs (SACUA)
President Coleman called on Professor Bruno Giordani, chair of SACUA, to
present the committee's annual report. In the report, Professor Giordani gave examples
of recently addressed issues that illustrate how the model of shared governance works at

advisory committees and discussed the work of the newly established position of
faculty ombuds. He concluded by stressing the importance of effective communication
in governance on the part of both faculty and administrators.
Annual Operating Request to the State for the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
Campus for FY 2007
Interim Provost Gramlich reviewed the highlights of the Ann Arbor campus's
operating request to the state for FY 2007, noting that it points out steps that have been
taken to contain costs and reduce expenditures but that certain factors outside of the
University's control will lead to increased costs. The formal request to the state
requests restoration of as much as possible of the $47.2 million reduction that the
University has experienced since FY 2002.
Annual Operating Request to the State for the University of Michigan-Dearborn
Campus for FY 2007
Chancellor Little reported that the request for the Dearborn campus is framed
around its strategic vision. Although the University of fully mindful of the state's fiscal
situation, it has also been impacted by several years of successive reductions in state
support, totaling $3.5 million. The request for the Dearborn campus calls for an
increase in state support of about 4%, or $1.0 million dollars, but at the same time

126



November Meeting, 2005

recognizes the need for the state to bring the level of funding for all higher education
institutions back to the levels from 2002.
Annual Operating Request to the State for the University of Michigan-Flint
Campus for FY 2007
Chancellor Mestas noted that the Flint request focuses on the need to add faculty
positions in the areas of strategic growth, continue to improve and expand campus
technology, and to enhance community partnership efforts.  The Flint campus's
requested increase is about $3.5 million.
President Coleman asked Executive Vice President Slottow about projected energy
costs. He responded that staff are monitoring futures prices of natural gas very
carefully and are working closely with the provost's office and with staff on the other
two campuses. However, campus units will be informed next week that the internal rate
for heating will be increased, and these costs will continue to exert a significant amount
of pressure on the operating budget in the future.
Central Campus Master Plan Update
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that Associate Provost Phil Hanlon would
provide an update on academic needs with respect to central campus planning and
University Planner Sue Gott would describe how the University Planner's Office is
responding to the academic needs.
Associate Provost Hanlon noted that the breadth and depth of activity occurring on
central campus means that planning for central campus embodies the full complexity of
the academic enterprise. He described the steps involved in the planning process,
including consultation, priority-setting, and formation of the plan. The three themes
that serve as the foundation for central campus planning are innovation, collaboration,
and excellence, and he illustrated how these themes lead to specific space needs within
buildings as well as the positioning of facilities and the units they house around the
campus.
University Planner Sue Gott gave a presentation describing how the academic
themes of innovation, collaboration, and excellence are realized in the Central Campus
master planning process. Ms. Gott described and illustrated the land use patterns that
have emerged on Central Campus, including a natural sciences corridor, a social
sciences corridor, a performing arts corridor, and an arts and humanities corridor. She
noted that the fundamental themes driving the plan are student life issues, the need for
collaboration/adjacencies/interdisciplinary work, the ability to attract the "brightest and
best," issues involving international studies, and the preservation of knowledge. The
physical planning principles involved in the master plan are to preserve future
flexibility, maximize  and  optimize  site  capacities, promote  redevelopment
opportunities, address building conditions, and enhance mobility.
Ms. Gott gave an update on several new projects already under construction,
noting how they incorporate the themes and planning principles involved in the master
plan. She concluded by illustrating how the projects discussed in the Central Campus
Plan update represent a continuation of the University's planning efforts over time,
driven by the University's mission, and incorporating academic priorities, the

127



November Meeting, 2005

Residential Life Initiative, the Health System Strategic Plan, physical planning
principles, and facility condition needs.
Parking and Transportation Strategic Plan Update
David Miller, director of Parking and Transportation, gave an update to illustrate
how parking and transportation plans align with University master plans in support of the
University's academic, research and health care mission. He enumerated Parking and
Transportation challenges, which include responding to growth on the Ann Arbor
campus, meeting the transportation needs for students, continuing the relationship with
AATA, promoting alternative transportation, and maintaining existing parking facilities.
Mr. Miller noted that the number of passengers on UM buses had increased 11%
over FY 2004, and 33% since 1999, for a total of 5.2 million passengers in 2005. He
described improvements that had been made in student bus service during the past year
and also noted that the MRide program, a joint program with the AATA, had a 24%
ridership increase in fall 2005.
Mr. Miller commented that the University is making concerted efforts to reduce
the use of cars and parking facilities in the central and medical campus areas by making
the transit system more attractive to faculty and staff. These efforts, which are included
in university's master plan for each area of campus, include making transit centers more
comfortable and convenient. In addition, he pointed out that one new parking structure
per year will be coming on board through 2010, with a possible 6th structure planned
beyond that.
Regent McGowan pointed out that the Arthur Miller Theatre and Walgreen
Auditorium will be opening before the parking facilities planned for that area are
completed. Mr. Miller described how parking needs will be accommodated after the
theatre and auditorium are completed in 2007. He noted that when the auditorium is
completed, the existing surface lot will be increased to 250 spaces and will be
controlled for special events. Between 2007 and 2009, when the parking structure for
that area will be under construction, a combination of initiatives will be put into place,
including reserving spaces in nearby lots and running bus service and valet service, if
necessary. The parking office will work with event coordinators for each event to
insure adequate parking.
Regent McGowan asked for assurance of the University's commitment to provide
convenient access to the theatre and auditorium once they are open. Executive Vice
President Slottow responded that Parking and Transportation officials and Dean
Kendall of the School of Music have been formulating plans to ensure that during the
interim period before completion of the structure the timing of events will be
coordinated between the school and the parking office. Executive Vice President
Slottow commented that although there is some flexibility in the overall plan for the
sequencing of new parking facilities, currently the need for parking on central campus
represents a higher priority than on North Campus. He assured the Regents that he, Mr.
Miller, and Dean Kendall are all committed to devising a parking plan that will satisfy
the patrons of events at the new facilities on North Campus.
Mr. Miller concluded his presentation by displaying maps indicating the locations
of future parking structures and a financial model indicating probable annual permit

128



November Meeting, 2005

rates through FY 2010. He reported the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
awarded the University of Michigan the "Gold Standard for Best Work Places for
Commuters."
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
primary agenda item for this month's committee meeting was to conduct an in-depth
review, including a financial and operational update, of M-CARE, as per the
committee's annual work plan. He said the committee learned that M-CARE and its
affiliated entities are operating at a very high level in a very complex environment. The
committee also finalized its committee calendar for 2006. Finally, the committee had
received a written quarterly report of the Life Sciences Institute.
Regent Brandon noted that the Investment Advisory Committee would be meeting
in Ann Arbor this weekend, and he would be stopping by their meeting to thank this
volunteer committee on behalf of the Regents for their service in helping the University
to continue to outpace most benchmarks in its investment performance.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor reported
that the committee had met that morning with SACUA to review its annual report. He
said that the committee was pleased to learn of the on-going meetings and dialog taking
place between SACUA and members of the administration on a number of issues.
The committee also received a report from the provost on faculty recruitment and
retention, and it reviewed president's office expense reports, finding everything in order.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda. Regent Brandon left the meeting
at this point, apologizing for having had a prior commitment.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of October 21, 2005.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report and
made the following comments about the University's policies with respect to
investments:
Comments Regarding University's Investments
Both my office and the President's Office have received a number of questions
over the past few months about the University's policies regarding the investment of
our endowment. So to be responsive, I want to take a few minutes to review these
policies.
First, let me note that these policies have been consistent and clear over a very
long period of time. We have the benefit of excellent and thoughtful work by our
Regents and by two faculty-led committees, one in 1978 and another in 1999, in
developing the rationale behind these policies and articulating the set of conditions
that must be met in the rare cases where an exception will be made to our normal
investment policies.
There is one overarching principle related to our endowment and investment
strategy: The University 's governing board and officers have a fiduciary responsibility
to protect our assets for the long term, so that we may leave to succeeding generations

129



November Meeting, 2005

a University at least as strong as the one with which we have been entrusted
Therefore, the primary purpose of our endowment is to generate the greatest possible
income, subject to an appropriate amount of risk, in support of the University 's
missions of teaching, research and service.
To accomplish this goal, it is important that we maintain an investment portfolio
diversified across afull range of legally recognized entities. To do otherwise would be
to increase our risk and decrease our investment returns - perhaps significantly so.
For this reason, our longstanding policy is to shield the endowment from political
pressures and to base our investment decisions solely on financial factors such as risk
and return.
However, the University also has recognized that there may be unusual instances
in which we should consider exceptions to this policy. The threshold for such an
exception has intentionally been set extremely high, for the reasons I've noted.
In 1978, the Board of Regents adopted a resolution including the following
language. "If the Regents shall determine that a particular issue involves serious
moral or ethical questions which are of concern to many members of the University
community, an advisory committee consisting of members of the University Senate,
students, administration and alumni will be appointed to gather information and
formulate recommendations for the Regents ' consideration. " Such a committee would
be ad hoc, appointed only after the Regents determine that a particular issue might
require a deviation from the normal investment policy.
The 1978 resolution does not specify what rises to the level of "serious moral or
ethical questions,"Y or what will constitute "many members of the University
community Yý but the 1978 faculty advisory committee report as well as subsequent
work by the 1999 tobacco divestment committee do help to clariy these.
The 1978 faculty committee that reviewed possible divestment from apartheid
South Africa wrote that the University has some responsibility to consider the ethical
implications of its investments "in those cases in which an extraordinary social evil is
apparent and a broad consensus develops within the University community concerning
the moral shortcomings of a particular firm or type of investment. " The committee
stated its belief that "the University should not seek out controversy but rather should
act only when a general consensus on a significant moral question has emerged within
the University community." It went on to say that the University "must make strenuous
efforts to avoid making commitments, as a corporate body, to political positions that
may intimidate its members, produce an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion, or
create obstacles to free inquiry."Y
The 1999 committee to investigate tobacco divestment was created by President
Bollinger in accordance with the Regents resolution, after several years of sustained
community concern about this issue. Although it is impossible to affix a number or a
percentage to what constitutes broad community consensus on a given issue, it is worth
noting that the Faculty Senate Assembly, Michigan Student Assembly and a number of
other University leadership groups passed formal resolutions or in other ways

130



November Meeting, 2005

In his charge to the committee, the University's chief financial officer asked it to
determine whether the holding of tobacco securities "is antithetical to the core
missions of the University of Michigan and, therefore, merit divestiture."  The
committee also undertook to determine what features of tobacco products and what
activities of the tobacco industry warranted singling out tobacco securities for
potential divestment.
According to the 1999 committee, in order to justify divestment, "the magnitude
of both the misbehavior in question and the harm caused by that misbehavior must be
so extreme that the company or industry would be a clear outlier in the corporate
community. "
In recommending divestment, the committee argued that tobacco companies make
a product that is unique in its capacity to cause death in its intended use, with more
than 400,000 deaths in the United States and more than 4 million deaths worldwide
each year as a result of tobacco use. The committee singled out the "dishonest and
reprehensible" behavior of the tobacco industry in targeting its products to young
people, artificially enhancing the addictiveness of tobacco products through the
addition of nicotine, denying the health effects of tobacco and suppressing scientific
research. It concluded that the health effects of tobacco and the actions of the tobacco
industry "are especially antithetical to the missions of this University, given our
commitment to teaching, research and service in the fields of health care and public
health. "
These two instances - apartheid in South Africa and the deadly effects of tobacco
- are the only two instances in the University's history when exceptions have been
made to our investment policy.
So in the future, such exceptions will continue to be rare. We will ask the Regents
to appoint an ad hoc committee to investigate the ethical and moral implications of our
investments only when the following three conditions have been met:
1.    The concern to be explored must express the broadly and consistently held
position of the campus community over time;
2.    There must be reason to believe that the behavior or action in question may be
antithetical to the core mission and values of the University.
3.    There must be reason to believe that the organization, industry or entity to be
singled out may be uniquely responsible for the problems identified.
I will post additional information about these policies to my website, along with
links to the South Africa and Tobacco divestment reports. I encourage anyone who is
interested in our investment policies to read these thoughtful documents.
I invite any questions or comments that the Board may have.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman said that in order to assure that the required quorum would be
present for consideration of the conflict of interest items, they would be considered at
this point. She announced that the agenda includes six conflict of interest items, each of
which requires six votes for approval. Regent Richner requested recusal from the
request for a subcontract agreement between the University of Michigan and Innovative
Biotherapies, Inc. Therefore, this item was removed from consideration until the
following month. On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent White, the
Regents unanimously approved the following five items.

131



November Meeting, 2005

Approval of a Contract with Gladwin Center
The Regents approved a contract with the Gladwin Center for use of their

Purchase Order Agreement with Michigan Aerospace Corporation
The Regents approved an agreement with Michigan Aerospace Corporation to
build and test a conceptual design of a stern-ramp deployable surface and underwater
recovery vehicle that will simultaneously launch and allow for automated recover of
marine unmanned vehicles. Because Dr. Lennard Fisk, partial owner of Michigan
Aerospace Corporation, is also a University of Michigan employee, this agreement falls

provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   The parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and
Michigan Aerospace Corporation.
2.   The terms of the agreement conform to University policy. The period of performance
is expected to be from September 1, 2005-August 31, 2006, and the amount payable to

with access, parking, utilities, pedestrians, encroachments, and/or other matters pertaining to
the interactions between the Facility and real property owned by the Educational Institution,
and (ii) providing for other matters related thereto.
WHEREAS, the Authority has been incorporated under and pursuant to the

of 1963 (the "State Constitution"), or any of its agencies; and
WHEREAS, the Educational Institution has been maintained and created pursuant
to Sections 4 and 5 of Article 8 of the State Constitution; and
WHEREAS, the State and the Educational Institution desire that the Authority
finance the acquisition, construction, renovation and/or equipping of the Facility in
consideration of (i) the Educational Institution granting a license to the Authority to enter
upon the site of the Facility (the "Site") in order to undertake such construction, renovation
and/or equipping, (ii) the Educational Institution undertaking on behalf of the Authority the
oversight of such construction, renovation and/or equipping and (iii) the Educational

and the Authority is willing to provide such financing in consideration of the items described
above; and
WHEREAS, in accordance with the Construction and Completion Assurance
Agreement, the State and the Educational Institution desire that the Authority acquire the

will be constructed by the Educational Institution on behalf of the Authority, and it is
intended that the Site and the Facility be conveyed to the Authority by the Educational
Institution; and
WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Facility by the Authority for use by and lease to
the Educational Institution and the State is necessary in order for the State and the
Educational Institution to carry out necessary governmental functions and to provide
necessary services to the people of the State as mandated or permitted by constitution and

157



NOVEMBER MEETING, 2005 - APPENDIX C

law, and the use of Act 183 to accomplish such acquisition represents the most practical
means to that end at the lowest cost to the State and the Educational Institution; and
WHEREAS, Section 7 of Act 183 provides that the Lease shall be approved by the
Authority, by the State Administrative Board of the State and by concurrent resolution of the
Legislature of the State concurred in by a majority of the members elected to and serving in
each house and if the Lease is for an institution of higher education existing or created
pursuant to Section 4, 5, 6 or 7 of Article 8 of the State Constitution, then in addition, the
Lease shall be authorized by the institution of higher education and signed by its authorized
officer and, accordingly, it is necessary that the Educational Institution authorize and
approve the Lease; and
WHEREAS, if it is determined that (i) the Authority will require an easement from
a public road to the Facility over real property owned by the Educational Institution so that
the Authority has access to the Facility, (ii) the Educational Institution will require for future
use certain easements through the Facility, (iii) the Authority and the Educational Institution
will require an agreement to share a common structural wall, (iv) the Authority will require
an easement over real property owned by the Educational Institution so that the Authority
has sufficient parking available in connection with the reasonable use of the Facility, and/or
(v) the Authority and/or the Educational Institution will require other easements and/or
agreements pertaining to the Facility and/or real property owned by the Educational
Institution (such as, but without limitation, easements and/or agreements pertaining to
pedestrian traffic, utility lines, and/or encroachments), then in order to meet any such
requirement, it may be necessary for an authorized officer of the Educational Institution to
approve an Easement Agreement or Easement Agreements to provide for such easements
and/or agreements;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY

authorized to approve such changes in and modifications to the Lease as do not materially
alter the substance and intent thereof as expressed in the Lease and the request for action
submitted to the Regents in connection therewith; provided such officer is not hereby
authorized to approve a change in the Lease with respect to the range of rental, the

and obligations specified in the Construction and Completion Assurance Agreement (only
upon its execution by the authorized officer of the Educational Institution) and the Lease
(only upon its execution by the authorized officer of the Educational Institution) and

Educational Institution hereby recognizes that it would execute and deliver the Lease even if
title to the Facility would not pass upon termination of the Lease.
8.   The Educational Institution recognizes that the Authority shall pay for costs of
the Facility in an amount not in excess of $7,200,000.
9.   All ordinances, resolutions and orders or parts thereof in conflict with the

DECEMBER MEETING, 2005
The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
December 15, 2005
The Regents convened at 2:10 p.m. in the155 Regents' Room. Present were
President Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor,
and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Interim Provost
Gramlich, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President
Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President
Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, Vice President Ulaby, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regent McGowan arrived at 2:50 p.m.; Regent White left the meeting at
3:00 p.m.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order and welcomed everyone to the final
Board of Regents' Meeting of 2005.
President Coleman commented on the presentations to be made at the meeting.
She also announced that Chancellor Mestas had recently made a generous gift of
$50,000 toward scholarship support for UM-Flint students, in addition to a $500,000
bequest for the Juan E. Mestas Scholarship. She thanked him for his generosity.
President Coleman also noted that this would be the last meeting for Vice
President Fawwaz Ulaby, who is stepping down after seven years as vice president for
research. She thanked him for his leadership and a round of applause followed.
President Coleman commented that the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) would
be returning to campus October 24 through November 12, 2006. Ann Arbor will be the
only venue in the United States where the RSC will be performing any of the plays in
its complete cycle of Shakespeare's plays it will be doing that year.
Regent Maynard commented about how much Chancellor Mestas' gift meant to
the University of Michigan-Flint campus, and that it speaks to the great leadership he
has provided.
Presentation: "Nursing at Michigan: It Makes All the Difference"
President Coleman introduced Dean Ada Sue Hinshaw, who made a presentation
about current programs and activities at the School of Nursing. She noted that the
Bachelor of Science in Nursing program has increased from 456 students in 2001 to 615
in 2005, and that the "Accelerated Second Career Program," which began in 2004 with
24 students, doubled in size in 2005. Dean Hinshaw reported that the school ranks third
nationally, its B.S.N.-Ph.D. program is one of the top programs in the country, and
research productivity has dramatically increased in recent years. The two major
challenges faced by the school are recruitment and retention of faculty and the need for
expansion and/or renovation to meet current needs for space.
Following the presentation, Dean Hinshaw responded to questions from President
Coleman and the Regents. President Coleman then called on Vice President Harper to
provide an overview of the activities of the Division of Student Affairs.

161



December Meeting, 2005

Division of Student Affairs Overview
Vice President Harper described the mission and functions of the Division of
Student Affairs (DSA), noting that the mission statement includes commitment to
students' learning, development of the whole student, a diverse campus community,
partnerships with schools and colleges, and student transformation. She described the
varied functions of the DSA and noted that the work of the division is informed by
theory and research, most of which is concerned with systematic change in students
over time while in college. She described the characteristics of the four generations that
can currently be found on college campuses, and noted that each of these has a common
set of attitudes, beliefs and behaviors, and location in the historical continuum. She
described the general traits of current undergraduate students, who are members of the
"Millenium" generation, and specific characteristics of Michigan undergraduates,
noting that these data inform the division's program offerings and other student life
initiatives.
She concluded that the challenge is to "invite students to bring their life
experiences into the learning process, to reflect upon their own and others' perspectives,
to expand their viewpoint, and to apply new understanding to their lives. At Michigan,
we also aspire to have our students live the Michigan difference by making a
contribution to their university community and also by changing the world in which
they live."
Following some discussion, President Coleman called on Steve Grafton, director
of the Alumni Association.
Alumni Update
Mr. Grafton noted that one of the biggest factors in alumni involvement is their
experience as students. He provided an update on what he has been hearing from
alumni and the kinds of feedback they give about the University and other issues that
are important to them. Mr. Grafton also commented that for some time the Alumni
Association has wanted to develop relationships with alumni who live overseas and that
President Coleman's recent visit to China provided the impetus for the association to
enhance its relationship with alumni in China. The Alumni Association plans to return
to China regularly to further develop this relationship. He praised President Coleman
for her leadership in supporting global outreach to University alumni.
Mr. Grafton informed the Regents about the feedback he's received about the
University from a series of meetings with alumni that he has been convening around the
country. Of particular interest, he noted that alumni are proud of the University. They
are pleased with the University's efforts to enhance the undergraduate experience and to
improve student housing, but express concern about the affordability of and access to
quality higher education. They also value the University's efforts to achieve diversity
and are concerned about the decline in state support for higher education. With respect
to Michigan Stadium, alumni are strongly in favor of having it remain the nation's
largest college football stadium.
Mr. Grafton concluded that alumni express a high degree of satisfaction with the
University of Michigan, and the Alumni Association is continuing its efforts to enhance
alumni participation and to engage alumni more deeply in the life of the University.

162



December Meeting, 2005

Following some discussion about Mr. Grafton's report, President Coleman turned
to the regular agenda. She noted that due to the fact that there were no committee
meetings this month there would be no committee reports.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of November 17, 2005.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the
Plant Extension Report, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action Report. He
announced that the Hill Auditorium renovation project had received an honor award
from the AIA Detroit. He commented that the units had been informed of sharp
increases in the cost of natural gas, even though actions taken by the University on a
number of levels had helped to mitigate these costs somewhat.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report.   Vice President Ulaby submitted the Report of Projects
Established, November 1-November 30, 2005.
University of Michigan Health System. There was no additional report.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper introduced members of her
staff who were present at the meeting and called attention to the recommended
reappointment of Susan Eklund as dean of students.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little updated the Regents about
progress in the Dearborn campus's efforts to certify its public safety officers. He
reported that the two required public hearings had taken place earlier that month and a
formal proposal would be brought forward for Regental approval early in 2006. He said
that the primary reasons the campus is seeking certification are to give officers the
ability to enforce traffic regulations and to intervene in potentially violent or dangerous
situations. He said that the total cost of completing the certification process would be
$200,000 over a four-year period.
Chancellor Little also reported that the UM-Dearborn had received a Ford
Foundation "Difficult Dialogs" award, and this represents a validation of the
importance of the campus's "metropolitan vision."
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas commented that the campus's
strategic plan has been endorsed unanimously by all campus constituencies and is now
in the process of being implemented.  The three pillars of the plan: academic
excellence, student centeredness, and engaged citizenship, are being incorporated into
the budget planning process for next year.
Students displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Provost Gramlich reported that in
early September the University had admitted 65 students from campuses in New
Orleans as non-candidate-for-degree ("NCFD") students, which allowed them to
continue progress toward their degrees with the understanding that they would return to
their home institutions when these institutions reopened. The students had received
tuition grants covering the full cost of tuition and fees. In November, officials at
Tulane, Loyola, and the University of New Orleans confirmed that those institutions

163



December Meeting, 2005

were prepared to welcome students back in January, while Xavier University, which
will not be reopening yet, has authorized the University of Michigan to retain its
students for another term.
In November all of these NCFD student were notified that they were expected to
return to their home institutions unless extenuating circumstances made it impossible
for the student to make progress toward his or her degree. He noted that federal
regulations preclude the University of Michigan from providing aid to these students
who remain at Michigan unless authorized by their home institution. Students with
extenuating circumstances are being dealt with on a case-by-case basis in the individual
admitting offices, while students who wish to transfer will be considered for admission
and financial aid based on the University's standard eligibility requirements.
Associate Provost Lester Monts responded to questions about this program.
Regent Newman pointed out that there was an understanding among the New Orleans
universities and the University of Michigan and other institutions that had temporarily
accommodated the displaced students that the accommodation would last only until the
home institutions were able to reopen and welcome them back. President Coleman and
Associate Provost Monts pointed out that each student's situation was being treated on
a case-by-case basis.
Michigan Student Assembly Report. MSA President Jesse Levine thanked
President Harper for her leadership on behalf of students. He then gave updates on
current MSA programs and activities.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May reported that there had been a large
number of new pledges to the campaign in the past few months, bringing the total raised
to date to $1.946 billion. Vice President May submitted the report of voluntary support
for November, 2005.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 3 retiring
faculty members.
Brian A. Burt, Ph.D., professor of dental public health in the School of Public
Health and adjunct clinical professor in the School of Dentistry, will retire from active
faculty status on December 31, 2005.
Professor Burt received his B.DSc. degree from the University of Western
Australia in 1960, his M.P.H. degree from the University of Michigan in 1966, and his
Ph.D. degree from the University of London in 1973. He joined the University of
Michigan faculty in 1974 as a visiting associate professor of dental public health; he
was appointed associate professor in 1976 and promoted to professor in 1981. He was
appointed associate professor of dentistry in 1976 and promoted to professor in 1987.

189



December Meeting, 2005

He became clinical professor of dentistry in 1989, adjunct professor in 1993, and
adjunct clinical professor in 2001.
A leader in the field of dental public health, Professor Burt has made
ground-breaking contributions, including several classic papers and a book, co-authored
with Dr. Stephen Eklund, that is considered the basic text in the field. Professor Burt's
research has largely centered on identifying risk factors for caries and periodontal
diseases and on prevention of these conditions at the community level. In particular, he
has focused on the effectiveness of fluoride in retarding caries development both in
public health and in dental practice. He is currently working with colleagues on a
federally-funded project, the Detroit Center for Research on Oral Health Disparities. He
was appointed director of the Program in Dental Public Health in 1983, and served as
chair of the Department of Community Health Programs from 1985-95.
Professor Burt has received the Distinguished Service Award from the
American Association of Public Health Dentistry and the H. Trendley Dean
Distinguished Scientist Award from the International Association for Dental Research.
He is the editor of Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology, and in 1997, he was
named a Diplomate of the American Board of Dental Public Health.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Brian A. Burt professor emeritus of dental public health.
Michael M. Chen, Ph.D., professor of mechanical engineering in the College of
Engineering, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2005.
Professor Chen received his B.S. degree from the University of Illinois at
Urbana- Champaign in 1955 and his S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1957 and 1961, respectively. He was an assistant professor at
Yale University from 1963-69, associate professor at New York University from
1969-73, and professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from
1973-91. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as a professor in 1991.
As a scholar of unusual depth and range, Professor Chen seamlessly integrates
the areas of thermo-fluid sciences--fluid mechanics, heat transfer, thermodynamics,
applied mathematics, and numerical analysis--with a clarity of thinking that is amazing
to his colleagues. He has applied his understanding of these physical sciences to such
problems as melting, welding, radiation, optical devices, biological systems, blood
flow, interaction of lasers with materials, development of scientific instruments,
transport in fluidized beds, and porous media. Above all, he has investigated these
diverse phenomena both experimentally and theoretically with equal ease. A first-rate
scientist and original thinker, Professor Chen is completing a unique book on
convection heat transfer that explains his methodology for formulating and solving
physical problems, and he recently developed a revolutionary numerical method for
solving two-phase moving boundary problems.
Professor Chen is the author of two other books, ten book chapters, and nearly two
hundred other publications. From 1991-93 he served as the director of the Thermal
Transport and Thermal Processing Program at the National Science Foundation. His
honors include the prestigious ASME Heat Transfer Memorial Award and election as an
ASME Fellow. Professor Chen is a kind and caring teacher whose advice is sought and
valued by students and colleagues alike.
The Regents now salute this faculty member by naming Michael M. Chen
professor emeritus of mechanical engineering.

December Meeting, 2005

Robert L. Kyes, Ph.D., professor of German in the College of Literature,
Science and the Arts, will retire from active faculty status on December 31, 2005.
Professor Kyes received his A.B. degree from the University of Michigan in
1958, his A.M. degree from Brown University in 1959, and his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Michigan in 1964. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
instructor in 1962 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1964, associate professor
in 1968, and professor in 1974.
Professor Kyes has achieved great distinction nationally and internationally as a
scholar of Old Franconian and Old Saxon. He is a recognized and widely respected
authority on the history of the Germanic languages and has authored, co-authored, or
co-edited seven books and monographs concerning historical linguistics as it relates to the
Germanic languages. His published articles and book reviews range impressively across
topics as diverse as Dutch phonology, pedagogy, and language attitudes in sixteenth and
seventeenth century Germany. He was the co-recipient of a grant from the National
Endowment of the Humanities for reconstructing the grammar of Proto-Germanic, a
project of great value to the field of historical linguistics.
Within the classroom, Professor Kyes was recognized as an excellent teacher who
taught rigorous courses on the history of the German language, German dialectology, and
various Germanic languages. He served as the undergraduate concentration advisor from
1995-2002 and received the Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Concentration
Advising in 1999. In appreciation for his dedicated instruction, his former graduate
students published a Festschrift in his honor in 2000, and another of his former students
established the endowed Mun-Kyes Fund to help support graduate student research in
Germanic linguistics. Professor Kyes served as chair of the Department of Germanic
Languages and Literatures from 1985-1995 and was a key architect of the department's
embrace of radical interdisciplinarity, for which it has received national and international
recognition.
The Regents salute this distinguished scholar by naming Robert L. Kyes professor
emeritus of German.

participating in this matter due to a conflict of interest.
Because Dr. H. David Humes is both an employee of the University who will
serve a principal investigator on the subcontract, and a founder, owner, director and
officer of InnoBio, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest
Statute.   The following    information  is provided   in  compliance with    statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and InnoBio.
2.   The terms of the proposed agreement conform to University policy. The project at the
University is to be conducted over an initial twelve-month period at an estimated total
cost of $125,937. Since research agreements are often amended, the agreement
includes provisions for changes in time, amount, and scope. University procedures for
approval of these changes will be followed and additional review by the Conflict of

JANUARY MEETING, 2006

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
January 20, 2006
The Regents convened at 9:25 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner,
Taylor, and White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice
President Forrest, Interim Provost Gramlich, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice
President Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May,
Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, and
Vice President Wilbanks.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She welcomed Vice President
Steve Forrest to his first Regents' Meeting and commented on the recent campus MLK
Day activities. President Coleman also called attention to several recent deaths. She
noted that as a result of the successful conclusion of the provost search, she would be
recommending the appointment of Teresa Sullivan as provost and executive vice
president for academic affairs.
Presentation: "Making the Michigan Difference in the Liberal Arts"
President Coleman introduced Dean Terrence McDonald, who gave a presentation
about the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA). Dean McDonald first
showed a brief video depicting individual students expressing the difference that the
education they've received at Michigan has made in their lives. He then went on to
describe the college, noting that it is a comprehensive liberal arts college with more than
18,000 undergraduate and graduate students and more than 800 tenure-track faculty
members. More than 2,000 LSA courses are offered each semester, and 65 languages are
taught. In addition, 71 of the college's departments, programs, and fields of study are
ranked among the top 25 in the nation, and many of these are in the top 10 and top 5.
Dean McDonald observed that the college's graduation rates and first-year
retention rates are among the highest in the country, and many of its initiatives are
ranked among the best in the nation. He described a number of the college's academic
initiatives and research highlights, and described recently completed and under
construction new facilities that will benefit the college.
Dean McDonald noted that it is a continuous challenge for the college to recruit
and retain outstanding faculty and to maintain the undergraduate experience it provides
in the face of growing enrollment and reduced resources.
Following the presentation, Dean McDonald responded to questions from the
Regents regarding his biggest challenges and the increasing size of the first year class.
He commented that his biggest challenge is to maintain the college's outstanding faculty
and student body while responding to the University's fiscal situation. In response to a
question about the larger first year class size in recent years, he described measures

199



January Meeting, 2006

being taken to more accurately predict enrollment yield. He also noted that the college
has developed a system for adding extra class sections to deal with increased demand
created by the increased enrollment, so that students are not faced with increased class
sizes.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported that the
committee had covered three topics during its meeting the day before. The first was a
review of the first six months performance of the Hospitals and Health Centers (HHC)

January Meeting, 2006

Worley, Daniel T., Clinical Lecturer in Music Composition, School of Music, April 30, 2005
Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 3 retiring
faculty members.
Howard Shevrin, Ph.D., professor of psychology in the Medical School and in
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 2005.
Professor Shevrin received his B.S. degree from the City College of New York
in 1948 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Cornell University in 1951 and 1954,
respectively. He received postdoctoral training at the Menninger Foundation and
completed psychoanalytic training at the Topeka Institute for Psychoanalysis. He joined
the University of Michigan faculty in 1973 as a professor and chief clinical psychologist
in the Department of Psychiatry in the Medical School, and received a joint appointment
as professor of psychology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts in 1975.
For more than 50 years, Professor Shevrin has pushed the boundaries between
neuroscience and psychoanalysis, finding evidence that psychoanalytic concepts could
be documented through physical measures of brain activity. In 1968, he published the
first report of brain responses to unconscious visual stimuli, thus providing strong,
objective evidence for the existence of the unconscious at a time when most scientists
were skeptical.  He also showed that--consistent with Freud's views--unconscious
perceptions are processed differently from conscious perceptions. Recently, Professor
Shevrin's research has suggested a link between repressive personality traits and a
longer-than-average delay between the application of a stimulus and the conscious
awareness of that stimulus. He and colleagues have also found brain markers for the role
of unconscious emotional conflict in producing social phobias. These and other studies
have helped form the foundation for the new field of neuropsychoanalysis.
Professor Shevrin is the author of over 150 publications, including an
award-winning psychoanalytic novel in verse form, The Dream Interpreters. In 2003, he
received the prestigious Mary S. Sigourney Award in recognition of his outstanding
achievements in psychoanalytic research.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated
service by naming Howard Shevrin professor emeritus of psychology.
Kathryn   W. Tosney, Ph.D., professor of molecular, cellular, and
developmental biology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, retired from
active faculty status on December 31, 2005, after a distinguished career as a teacher and
researcher.
Professor Tosney received her B.S. degree from the University of Oregon in
1975 and her Ph.D. degree from Stanford University in 1980. After completing her
postdoctoral studies, she joined the University of Michigan faculty as an assistant
professor in 1984 and was promoted to associate professor in 1989 and professor in
1995.
Professor Tosney is an internationally recognized leader in developmental
neurobiology. Her research has focused on studying the cellular mechanisms that allow
the axons of motor neurons to find their way out of the spinal cord and then connect to
the proper set of target muscle cells in the developing limb. Her experiments are notable
for their elegant approach and clear results, with some requiring her to conduct delicate
microsurgery on developing chick embryos, and others calling for innovative cell

220



January Meeting, 2006

culture approaches. A superb teacher, Professor Tosney developed novel approaches to
help students grasp difficult concepts in developmental biology. For example, she
created an origami model of the embryo to illustrate the complex cell movements that
occur during the critically important process of gastrulation. During lectures, she also
made extensive use of images of developing embryos in whole mount and conventional
histological sections that she collected from her research.
Professor Tosney was associate department chair from 1991-95 and served on
the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts Executive Committee and the LS&A
and Rackham divisional boards. She was a member of many federal grant review
panels, served on the editorial boards of two journals, and was a board member and
treasurer of the Society for Developmental Biology.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar for her dedicated service by
naming Kathryn W. Tosney professor emerita of molecular, cellular, and developmental
biology.
Sue A. Woestehoff, Ph.D., professor of education in the School of Education and
Human Services at the University of Michigan-Flint, retired from active faculty status on
December 31, 2005.
Professor Woestehoff received her B.S., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of Minnesota in 1964, 1965, and 1969, respectively. She joined the
University of Michigan-Flint faculty as a lecturer in 1969 and was promoted to assistant
professor in 1971, associate professor in 1975, and professor in 1982.
Professor Woestehoff's research and publications focused on children's
literature and language arts. Within the school, she served three terms as chair of the
Department of Education (1976-78, 1986-89, and 1999-2001), played a major role in the
development of the graduate program, and coordinated the state periodic review
process. She chaired the College of Arts and Sciences Dean Search Committee and the
School of Education and Human Services Academic Affairs Advisory Committee, served
several terms on the College of Arts and Sciences Executive Committee, and was a
founding member of the executive committee of the School of Education and Human
Services. She also served on the Academic Affairs Advisory Committee of the Senate
Advisory Committee on University Affairs.
Within the broader professional community, Professor Woestehoff held a
number of positions in the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), including
president of the Children's Literature Assembly, chair of the Committee on Storytelling,
and member of both the board of directors and the literature commission. She also
co-edited a book on storytelling published by NCTE. Professor Woestehoff's honors
include the Distinguished Teaching Award from the University of Michigan-Flint and
the Distinguished Faculty Award from the Michigan Association of Governing
Boards.
The Regents now salute this dedicated faculty member by naming Sue A.
Woestehoff professor emerita of education.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted memorial statements for three
faculty members whose deaths had been reported previously. She also reported the
death of David Fleischer, associate professor of pharmacological sciences, who had
died on January 7th at age 61. A memorial statement for Professor Fleischer will be
included with the February agenda.

January Meeting, 2006

The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Thomas Carli, M.D., clinical associate professor of psychiatry and
assistant dean for clinical affairs in the Medical School. Dr. Carli died on December 9,
2005, at the age of 59.
Driven to improve the care of patients with chronic illnesses and to integrate care
for mental illnesses with that for physical illness, Dr. Carli devoted his career to
transforming the delivery of health care. He worked tirelessly to initiate and sustain
efforts that served patients within the University Health System, Washtenaw County,
and the State of Michigan.
Dr. Carli received his undergraduate degree in psychology from Wayne State
University in 1968 and his M.D. degree from the University of Michigan Medical
School in 1972. After completing his internship, he spent a year of psychiatry residency
at the University of British Columbia before returning to the University of Michigan,
where he rose to chief resident. From 1977-81, he worked in emergency and outpatient
psychiatry and then entered private practice. In 1985 he was recruited to the faculty,
where he served as an instructor and director of several outpatient psychiatry programs.
He was promoted to clinical assistant professor in 1990 and clinical associate professor
in 1997.
From 1995-2001, Dr. Carli served as director of one of the nation's first academic
managed behavioral health care organizations, the Michigan Center for Diagnosis and
Referral. In 1998, he became the founding medical director of the Washtenaw
Community Health Organization, an innovative joint program of the University Health
System and Washtenaw County that provides for the medical and mental health needs of
the county's mentally ill and underinsured residents. Recently, he was made medical
director of the Washtenaw Health Plan, which serves the county's uninsured residents.
Dr. Carli was a past president of the Michigan Psychiatric Society and in 2003 he was
appointed by Governor Granholm to the Michigan Mental Health Commission.
Dr. Carli was founding medical director of the UMHS Medical Management
Center, which re-shaped the way patients with chronic illnesses are cared for, and he
co-developed and served as founding medical director for Partnership Health, a joint
program with Ford Motor Company focused on chronic illnesses. He also was medical
director for behavioral health at M-CARE and director of workplace and university
programs for the U-M Depression Center.
As we mourn this untimely loss, our condolences go to his wife, Laura Nitzberg;
his daughter, Anna; his sons, Tatha and Nikos; and his daughter-in-law, Kimberly
(Stec) Carli.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of Emmett Leith, Schlumberger Professor of Engineering and professor of
electrical engineering and computer science. Professor Leith, a revered College of
Engineering faculty member for 52 years and one of the early innovators of holography
in the 1960s, died on December 23, 2005, at the age of 78.
Professor Leith received B.S. and M.S. degrees in physics and a Ph.D. degree in
electrical engineering, all from Wayne State University. He also received an honorary
Doctor of Science degree from University of Aberdeen. His research touched areas such
as synthetic aperture radar, optical processing, and holography.
At the Optical Society's 1964 spring conference, Professor Leith and other
College of Engineering researchers displayed a revolutionary laser-transmission

222



January Meeting, 2006

hologram that proved to be a dramatic first step in developments that made life easier,
safer, and more efficient. Double-exposed holograms, for example, provided data that
improved the design of containers for the transport and storage of nuclear materials.
Aircraft engineers used holography to visualize shockwaves and pinpoint the areas of
greatest stress on wings and turbine blades. Forensic scientists have used holograms to
uncover mysteries in the body. Optical computers use holography to store data. And
today's everyday credit cards use holograms to record and store information. Through
the development of holography, Professor Leith changed the world.
Professor Leith authored or coauthored about 200 papers. He is listed in various
publications, including Who 's Who in America. He is a fellow of IEEE, the Optical
Society of America, and the SPIE, and he is an honorary member of the Engineering
Society of Detroit. He received numerous awards, including the Liebmann Award of
IEEE, the Herbert Ives Medal of OSA, the Gold Medal of SPIE, the Progress Medal of
the Royal Photographic Society of Britain, and the National Medal of Science. He was a
member of the National Academy of Engineering.
Professor Leith is survived by June, his wife of 49 years, their two daughters, Pam
Wilder of San Jose, California, and Kim Leith of Baltimore, Maryland, and three
grandchildren.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of John R. Omnaas, assistant research scientist in the medicinal chemistry
program in the College of Pharmacy. Dr. Omnaas died at the age of 59 on November
19, 2005.
Dr. Omnaas earned his B.S. degree in chemistry with distinction from the
University of Minnesota in 1968 and his Ph.D. degree in biochemistry from The
University of Texas at Austin in 1977. He was a research associate at the University of
Miami School of Medicine until 1980, when he became a postdoctoral investigator at
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He came to the University of Michigan School of
Medicine in 1982 to continue his postdoctoral research and was appointed senior
research fellow in the College of Pharmacy in 1984. He became a research investigator
in the College of Pharmacy in 1991 and was promoted to assistant research scientist in
2002.
In addition to being an excellent scientist, Dr. Omnaas was an extraordinarily
gifted and patient mentor to the numerous undergraduate and graduate students who
trained in his lab. His passing leaves a deep void among his many friends and
colleagues.
Among Dr. Omnaas' s other interests was a passion for trains. He was a long-time
volunteer of the Steam Railroading Institute of Owosso, Michigan, where he spent
many happy hours maintaining and repairing the Pere Marquette Railway No. 1225
steam locomotive.

FEBRUARY MEETING, 2006

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
February 17, 2006
The Regents convened at 9:25 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Deitch, Maynard, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Interim Provost Gramlich, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President
Kelch, Vice President Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor
Mestas, Vice President Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice President
Wilbanks. Regent McGowan was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She noted that during the past
month she had addressed a meeting of the scholarly division of the American
Association of Publishers in support of the University's participation in the "Google
Book Search" project, and had attended a celebration of the opening of the Biomedical
Sciences Research Building. She commented that Governor Granholm had included a
2% increase for higher education in her 2007 budget proposal, and called attention to
the fact that Professor William Bolcolm's masterpiece, "Songs of Innocence and
Experience," recorded at Hill Auditorium, had received four Grammy Awards.
President Coleman also noted that the Children's and Women's Hospital replacement
project, to be discussed later in the meeting, is assumed to be the largest single
construction project in the state.
Presentation: "The Leaders and Best: What Makes Our School of Education
Different?"
President Coleman introduced Dean Deborah Loewenberg Ball, dean of the
School of Education. Dean Ball noted that inadequate education is a major issue facing
the world in the 21st century, and that the University of Michigan is in a position to take
the lead in offering solutions to this problem. She commented that almost half of the
school's students are involved in teacher certification programs at the undergraduate
and master's degree levels.  The remainder of the school's students are in
non-teacher-certification programs, including masters programs in higher education and
Ph.D. Programs.
Dean Ball said that School of Education faculty are of the highest quality, as
indicated by the school's overall ranking in 2005 of 9th nationally and first in the higher
education program, and that research performed at the school is among the most widely
cited and used research for policy-making and improvements in practice.  She
emphasized that the research being pursued by School of Education faculty focuses on
core problems of education and studies, and develops solutions for those problems by
examining the causes, designing and studying interventions, articulating policies, and
contributing to the improvement of professional education.

229



February Meeting, 2006

Dean Ball commented that the school trains a number of different education
professionals and described its efforts at educating teachers, including graduate student
instructors, in addition to K-12 teachers. She pointed out that the best way to improve
the performance of the nation's teachers is to build a reliable system of teacher
education and described the key elements necessary for this. She noted that the close
relationship between School of Education faculty and faculty in the other schools and
colleges helps to explain why the University of Michigan is positioned to take a leading
role in this.
Dean Ball described some of the School of Education initiatives that are under
development or under consideration to meet some of the challenges she described. She
concluded by describing the school's priorities and challenges going forward and
expressed confidence that the school is positioned to be able to make significant
advances in the field.
Regent White complimented Dean Ball on her presentation. Regent Newman
commented that everyone on the board deeply cares about education and urged Dean
Ball to let the Regents know if there is anything they can do to be supportive and
helpful. In response to a question from Regent Deitch about the reasons for the poor
performance of American students in math and science achievement measures, she gave
a number of reasons and said that the University is in a good position to make
contributions toward improving this situation.
Annual Report on Research
Vice President Forrest stated that the mission of the Office of the Vice President
for Research (OVPR) is to anticipate new research trends, to engage the diverse
communities in the research enterprise, to expedite the diffusion of new knowledge into
the classroom and the community, and to promote integrity in research and ensure
compliance with government regulations. He noted that research expenditures at the
University of Michigan have about doubled in the last 10 years to a total of about $800
million in 2006, although the growth rate has flattened somewhat over the past few
years.
He noted that approximately 75% of research expenditures derive from the federal
government, about 14% from the University, and about 4.5% from industry. He
described research expenditures by unit, noting that the Medical School (42%), College
of Engineering (18%), College of LS&A (9%), and the Institute for Social Research
(9%) make up the bulk of the research expenditures. He reported that more than 2,000
undergraduates and 12,000 graduate students are involved in research.
Vice President Forrest observed that the OVPR attempts to catalyze research ideas
from disparate groups to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts, and said that
the Michigan Nanotechnology Institute for Medicine and Biological Sciences is an
example of this. He announced a new OVPR initiative on energy science, technology,
and its impacts, with the goal of the University becoming one of the world's leading
universities in energy research. He explained the importance of industry research and
technology transfer to the University and the state, noting that while the University
ranks 8th in annual licensing revenue and in annual licensing revenue, industry research
funding as a percentage of total research funding (4.5%) is very low, ranking only 96th
nationally. Thus, he pointed out that industry research and partnerships provide the

230



February Meeting, 2006

largest opportunity for continued growth in research volume and listed some of the
University's strategies for doing so.
Vice President Forrest concluded by recognizing the highly competitive, global
nature of research, and described the vision of the OVPR as working to anticipate and
meet future opportunities and challenges. He then responded to questions regarding
how the University shares in the profits generated when it collaborates with industry,
explaining that this is done in a variety of ways, including taking an equity position in a
company and receiving royalties. The exact agreement is specific to each situation, but
the most important thing is to establish an agreement with a company. He noted that
the University makes every effort to ensure that companies it is involved with are
located in Michigan.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reviewed the
topics the committee had covered during its meeting the day before. The first agenda
topic involved a review of policies, practices, trends, and benchmark comparisons
regarding the endowment. The committee next reviewed the activities and structure of
the Michigan Health Corporation (MHC), a not-for-profit membership corporation
wholly owned by the Regents. The committee then had a preliminary look at the FY07
General Fund budget. Finally, the committee had a continuation of its January regular
bimonthly audit meeting and also met privately with the internal auditors to inquire
about the level of cooperation and support they are receiving from the University. The
committee had also received a written quarterly report on the Life Sciences Institute.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee.       Regent Richner
presented the report of this committee, because the chair, Regent Taylor, had been
unable to attend. Regent Richner noted that Regents Newman and Maynard had
attended this meeting in the absence of the other committee members. The Regents had
reviewed information on the increasing challenge related to the costs of health care
benefits and expressed support for the efforts of the administration. They also learned
about the "Michigan Healthy Community" initiative which is encouraging healthier
lifestyles on campus, and noted that the Regents were encouraged to participate in the
fitness challenge.  The Regents also were updated    about the University's
federally-mandated affirmative action plan for recruiting and retaining minority and
women faculty and staff.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 2 retiring
faculty members.
George H. Koepke, M.D., professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation in the
Medical School, retired from active faculty status in 1976, after a most productive
career as a clinician, teacher, and leader in the field of physical medicine and
rehabilitation (PM&R).

243



February Meeting, 2006

Dr. Koepke received his B.S. degree from the University of Toledo in 1945 and
his M.D. degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1949. He completed his internship
at the Toledo (Ohio) Hospital in 1950 and completed his PM&R residency at the
University of Michigan in 1953 as the department's first resident. After a year in private
practice, he joined the faculty in 1954 as an assistant professor. He was promoted to
associate professor in 1958 and professor in 1966. He retired in 1976, after having
served on the faculty for 22 years.
Dr. Koepke was a pioneer in the field of PM&R. Within the department, he
founded the Electroneuromyography (EMG) Laboratory and developed the Division of
Orthotics and Prosthetics for the care of patients with amputations. In the 1950s, at the
height of the polio epidemic, Dr. Koepke developed and implemented new
rehabilitation techniques for respirator-dependent patients. Working with Dr. Irving
Feller on the treatment of burn patients, Dr. Koepke also became known as a national
expert in burn rehabilitation. He was certified by the American Board of Physical
Medicine and Rehabilitation in 1955 and served as its chair from 1970-76. He was a
founding  member   of the   American   Association  of Electrodiagnosis  and
Electromyography  (now  the  American   Association  of Neuromuscular   and
Electrodiagnostic Medicine) and was one of its early presidents, and he was vice chair
of the American Board of Electrodiagnosis and Electromyography from 1988-92. He
was president of both the Washtenaw County Medical Society and the Michigan State
Medical Society.
Dr. Koepke was a strong mentor and a major influence on trainees in the field of
physical medicine and rehabilitation. He was instrumental in developing the science and
rationale for the clinical aspects of PM&R, including electrodiagnostic medicine,
peripheral neuropathy, amputation surgery, prosthetic rehabilitation, and rehabilitation
of burns. He has had a significant, lasting influence on the field of PM&R.
The Regents salute this distinguished faculty member for his dedicated service by
naming George H. Koepke professor emeritus of physical medicine and rehabilitation.
Cecil G. Miskel, Ed.D., professor of education in the School of Education,
retired from active faculty status on January 31, 2006.
Professor Miskel received his B.S. degree from the University of Oklahoma in
1963 and his M.S. and Ed.D. degrees from Oklahoma State University in 1967 and
1970, respectively. From 1970-82, he served on the faculty of the University of Kansas,
where he rose from assistant professor to associate professor (1973) to professor (1978)
and served as associate dean for research (1976-78) and associate vice chancellor for
research (1978-82). He joined the University of Utah in 1982, serving as professor and
chair of the Department of Educational Administration (1982-83) and dean of the
Graduate School of Education (1983-88). Professor Miskel joined the University of
Michigan faculty in 1988 as a professor and as dean of the School of Education.
During his ten years as dean, Professor Miskel led the School of Education to a
position of national leadership by recruiting leading faculty, building new strengths in
research, and creating two innovative and nationally recognized master's programs
designed to attract top students to the education field. Under his leadership, the school's
use of instructional technology was dramatically updated with the creation of the
Prechter Laboratory for Interactive Technology in 1994 and the design of special
multimedia classrooms in 1995 and 1997. During this period, ground-breaking research

244



February Meeting, 2006

was launched in areas such as early literacy, mathematics teacher education, assessment
of student learning and of teaching, and education policy.
Professor Miskel is an expert in school organization and administration and in
education policy analysis. His research and scholarship investigated state and national
policy issues related to instruction in reading; for this work, he received the William
Davis Memorial Award in 1980 and 1983. He served as editor of the Educational
Administration Quarterly for the 1987 and 1988 volumes and served two terms as a
member of its editorial board. He also co-authored six editions of Education
Administration. Theory, Research, and Practice, one of the leading textbooks in the
field of school administration.
The Regents now salute this distinguished teacher, scholar and administrator by
naming Cecil G. Miskel professor emeritus of education and dean emeritus.
Vice President Churchill also announced that this would be the last meeting for
Carol Volker of her staff, as Ms. Volker and her husband will be moving to Virginia.
Memorials. Vice President Churchill submitted a memorial statement for David
Fleischer, associate professor of pharmacological sciences.
The Regents of the University of Michigan acknowledge with profound sadness
the death of David Fleisher, Ph.D., associate professor of pharmaceutical sciences in
the College of Pharmacy. Professor Fleisher died at his home on January 7, 2006, after
a long fight with lymphoma. He was 6 1.
Professor Fleisher was born in Rochester, New York, and earned his B.S. degree
in pharmacy from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1967. He began his
career as a staff pharmacist, first at Children's Hospital in Buffalo and then at Strong
Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York. After earning his M.S. degree in applied
mathematics from the University of Rochester in 1977, Professor Fleisher and his
family relocated to Madison, Wisconsin, where he earned his Ph.D. degree in
pharmaceutics from the University of Wisconsin in 1983. He joined the University of
Michigan College of Pharmacy as an assistant research scientist in 1983, was appointed
assistant professor of pharmaceutics in 1985, and was promoted to associate professor
in 1992.
Professor Fleisher' s research focused on food and nutrient effects on drug
delivery, absorption, and metabolism, and his work had a very significant impact on
Food and Drug Administration regulatory guidelines. He was a highly respected
scientist and educator who touched the lives of all of his students and colleagues in a
very special way. Professor Fleisher will be remembered for his genuine interest in
people, and for his compassion and generosity. He was known for his extraordinary
kindness, his sense of humor, humility, and passion for life, and his remarkable capacity
to help and inspire those around him.

February Meeting, 2006

of the degree lists are on file in the Office of the Vice President and Secretary of the
University.
Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by
Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
The Regents then turned to consideration of the regular agenda.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) C.S. Mott
Children's and Women's Hospital Replacement Project
Executive Vice President Slottow commented that since completion of the
schematic design for this project, the size has increased by approximately 100,000 gross
square feet, to approximately 1,100,000 gross square feet, and it is recommended that
the budget be increased by 5% to accommodate increased programming, to achieve
LEED ("Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design") certification, and to meet
the increased cost of some of the materials. He noted that the UMHHC has updated its
strategic 10-year capital plan and the increased budget and scope is entirely consistent
with that plan. He said that Ms. Pat Warner, associate director and chief administrative
officer of C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, would be assisting with the schematic design
presentation.
Executive Vice President Kelch commented that he is "thrilled by the project," and
stated that it is an excellent representation of the Health System's commitment to
growth and investment in one of its strategic principles. He noted that the entire health
system will benefit from the project through prudent use of the facilities that will be
liberated by it. He observed that the costs associated with seeking LEED certification
for this particular project will be warranted over the long term.
Ms. Warner reported that numerous individuals had been involved in the design of
this project, including more than 450 faculty, staff, and students and more than 40
families and patients, all of whom will remain involved during the operational planning
stage. She thanked the Regents on behalf of all who have been involved in the project
"for the opportunity to create one of the most innovative and exciting children's and
women's hospital, not only in this country, but, I think, in the world." She also thanked
Dr. Kelch for his leadership and Regent Brandon for his role as a philanthropic leader in
the project.
Ms. Warner introduced Mr. Ronald W. Dennis, principal of HKS Architects, P.C.
and head of its health care section, and Mr. Douglas Compton, senior vice president
with HKS and lead designer. Mr. Compton displayed the site plan, noting that the
Arboretum is located along the east and southeastern border. He said that the footprint
of the structure has been maximized on the site in the shape of an "L", consisting of the
hospital portion of the structure (850,000 square feet and 12 stories high) and the
clinical and outpatient functions (250,000 square feet and 9 stories high). He described
the functions that would occur at the various levels of the structure, noting that patient
rooms would have a view of the arboretum and river valley and that extensive
landscaping is planned. There will be a sky bridge connecting the parking structure to
the hospital and a connector from this building to the second level of University

246



February Meeting, 2006

Hospitals and clinics. There will be a separate drive and entrance point for emergency
vehicles and walk-in traffic.
Mr. Compton displayed and described floor plans for the 2nd floor, which includes
the main lobby, retail food and gift shops, and a family resource center, the 4th floor
(diagnostic and treatment areas); and the 12th floor (representing a nursing unit). Ms.
Warner pointed out that locating the family resource center in the hub of the public
space is an innovative feature of the UM facility. Mr. Compton noted that there will be
separate elevator banks for the different user groups in the facility and that a regional
infectious disease containment unit will be located on the 12th floor. Another feature is
that all rooms, including those in the intensive care units, will be single rooms. There
will also be undeveloped shell space on each floor, providing room for growth.
Mr. Compton displayed photos showing views of the facility from various points
on campus, noting that it will be a visible and recognizable feature within the medical
complex. He noted that the exterior materials and coloration will be reflective of
existing campus architecture. The patient rooms and other areas of the facility will
incorporate extensive amounts of glass to provide natural light and outdoor views.
In response to a question from Regent Maynard about the use of the old women's
and children's facility, Dr. Kelch said that it will be renovated for use by adult services
programs, allowing for expansion of the old hospital and growth in adult services,
which will enable the entire health system to thrive. It was noted that construction of
the new facility is projected to be completed at the end of 2010 and move-in is
scheduled for Spring, 2011.
President Coleman pointed out that the space provided for the regional infectious
disease containment unit will be key to pandemic planning for the entire region. Dr.
Kelch noted that the building has been designed to address security concerns and will
feature limited and controllable access. In the worse case scenario, the entire hospital
could be turned into a controlled access, specialized use, facility. Ms. Warner
commented that at every entrance, individuals will be greeted by a human being. All
entrances will be staffed either 24 hours per day, or during all of the hours that the
entrance is open.
Regent Brandon stated that it was 26 years ago that his identical twin sons were
rushed to Mott Hospital where their lives were saved, so he is especially gratified to see
this project come to fruition. He announced that the original goal of $50 million for the
philanthropic campaign for this facility that he and Coach Carr and their spouses are
leading has been raised to $75 million. "I would take great pride in moving this item
for approval," he said. Regent Taylor seconded the motion, and the motion to approve
the revised budget, and scope, and schematic design for the University of Michigan
Hospitals and Health Centers C.S. Mott Children's and Women's Hospitals
Replacement Project as presented at the meeting was approved unanimously. A round
of applause followed.
Alternative Asset Commitment (Graham Partners II Co-Investment, L.P.)
The Regents were informed that a $20 million follow-on private equity
commitment had been made to Graham Partners II Co-Investment, L.P.

247



February Meeting, 2006

Alternative Asset Commitments (ARC Energy Fund V, L.P.; Rubenstein
Properties Fund, L.P.; Altor Fund II, L.P.)
On a motion by Regent White, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents
unanimously approved the following commitments: $13 million (Canadian dollars)
from the Long Term Portfolio to ARC Energy Fund V, L.P.; $20 million from the Long
Term Portfolio to Rubenstein Properties Fund, L.P.; and ~17 million from the Long
Term Portfolio to Altor Fund II, L.P.
Long Term Portfolio Asset Allocation
Executive Vice President Slottow explained that this is a request to widen the
range of the fixed income allocation in the Long Term Portfolio to allow for variances
in the fixed income allocation relative to the model portfolio approved in 2000, and to
make it consistent to the current investment environment. On a motion by Regent
Brandon, seconded by Regent Maynard, the Regents unanimously approved widening
the allowable range for fixed income allocation to 10 percent to 35 percent, which
would allow for variances in the fixed income allocation relative to the model portfolio
that are more consistent with that of other asset classes.
Regent Newman expressed appreciation to Mr. Erik Lundberg, the University's
chief investment officer, for all of his efforts in managing the University's investments.
Hutchins Hall Classroom 138 and Administrative Office Space Renovation
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved the Hutchins Hall Classroom 138 and Administrative Office
Space Renovation Project as described, and authorized issuing the project for bids and
awarding construction contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) Cancer and
Geriatrics Centers Building Cancer Center Infusion Expansion
On a motion by Regent Maynard, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
(UMHHC) Cancer and Geriatrics Centers Building Cancer Center Infusion Expansion
Project as described, authorized commissioning of the architectural firm of Ann Arbor
Architects Collaborative for its design, and authorized issuing the project for bids and
awarding construction contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget.
University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers (UMHHC) University
Hospital Clinical Laboratory Renovation
On a motion by Regent Brandon, seconded by Regent Richner, the Regents
unanimously approved the University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers
(UMHHC) University Hospital Clinical Laboratory Renovation project as described,
authorized commissioning the architectural firm of SSOE Inc. For its design, and
authorized issuing the project for bids and awarding construction contracts providing
that bids are within the approved budget.

248



February Meeting, 2006

Medical Sciences Research Building I (MSRB I)
On a motion by Regent Newman, seconded by Regent White, the Regents
unanimously approved the Medical Sciences Research Building I Mass Spectrometer
Laboratory Project as described, and authorized issuing the project for bids and
awarding construction contracts providing that bids are within the approved budget.
Stephen M. Ross School of Business Facilities Enhancement Project
Executive Vice President Slottow reported that Dean Dolan and colleagues have
raised $40 million in 9 months in order to support this project and successfully meet the
full financial commitment required by the $145 million budget. On a motion by Regent
Brandon, seconded by Regent White, the Regents unanimously authorized issuing bids
and awarding construction contracts for demolition and early procurement packages for
the Stephen M. Ross School of Business Facilities Enhancement Project provided that
bids are within the approved budget.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman announced that the agenda includes 3 conflict of interest items,
each of which requires 6 votes for approval. On a motion by Regent Newman,
seconded by Regent White, the Regents unanimously approved each of the following
items:
License Agreement with Cielo MedSolutions, LLC
The Regents approved a license agreement with Cielo MedSolutions, LLC, for the
technology entitled "ClinfoTracker" (UM File No. 2860). Because James Price, part
owner of Cielo MedSolutions, LLC, is also a University of Michigan employee, this
agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following
information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   The parties to the contract are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Cielo
MedSolutions, LLC.
2.   The license terms include giving Cielo an exclusive license with the right to grant
sublicenses. Cielo will pay a royalty on sales. The University will retain ownership of
the licensed technology and may continue to further develop it and use it internally.

February Meeting, 2006

Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Building Solid State Electronics Lab
Addition and Renovation
Executive Vice President Slottow noted that the original project approved by the
Regents in February 2005 involved a project budget of $28 million. Since that time, the
scope of the project has increased in size in order to accommodate the research needs of
a newly recruited faculty member and a $70 million grant to support nanotechnology
research. In addition, when the bids were analyzed, it was determined that the
complexity, safety standards, and some of the materials costs had not been adequately
recognized by the team of outside expert estimators in setting the original budget. All
of these factors have required an increase in the project budget to $48 million.
Executive Vice President Slottow pointed out that this is only the second time in
the past five years and more than 100 projects that it has been necessary to seek a
budget increase after the project has gone out to bid. The increased cost will be funded
by the College of Engineering, and the increased scope will be funded from investment
income.
Regent Brandon commented that the Finance, Audit and Investment Committee
takes these matters very seriously, and this situation has generated much discussion
within the committee. In addition to the change in scope and market factors, the project
estimating had not been up to the University's usual standards, and this will lead to a
re-evaluation of the estimating process. However, given these considerations, he said
he is convinced that the right thing to do is to move forward despite the increase in the
cost of the project.
Regent Deitch observed that the University has a huge volume of construction and
that he has great admiration for the talents of Associate Vice President Baier. He
observed, however, that given the current volume of construction, it may be worth
considering increasing the staffing in this area going forward.
Regent White pointed out that this project is unique in that it would be difficult to
scale it back given all of the safety issues and specialized equipment it involves.
However, if this were a different kind of project, there may have been some leeway in
eliminating some of the features.
Executive Vice President Slottow agreed that this project has very unique
technical requirements that require specialized expertise, and said that the comments are
well taken and will be carefully considered.
On a motion by Regent Deitch, seconded by Regent Brandon, the Regents
unanimously approved the revised project scope and budget for the Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science Building Solid State Electronics Lab Addition and
Renovation Project as described in the Regents Communication, and authorized issuing
the project for bids and awarding construction contracts providing that bids are within
the approved budget.
UM-Dearborn Safety Office
Chancellor Little commented that the certification of the public safety officers on
the Dearborn campus is planned to occur in a staged fashion over a period of four years.
He noted that there has been much discussion of this proposal on campus, and believes

251



February Meeting, 2006

this is a prudent step to take. On a motion by Regent Taylor, seconded by Regent
Brandon, the Regents unanimously approved the licensing of UM-Dearborn campus
safety officers pursuant to Public Act 120.
A five-minute break followed.
Public Comments
The Public Comments session began at 11:50 a.m. The Regents heard comments
from the following individuals, on the topics indicated: Jim Mogensen, citizen, on the
town/gown relationship; Alice Ralph, alumna, on the Gordon Hall Historic District;
David Boyle, alumnus, on UM neglect toward minorities; Andrea Dewees, student, on
support for international students and workers who encounter problems entering the US;
Rese Fox, student and member of the Michigan Student Assembly, on general student
concerns; and Elizabeth Neilson, student, on the University of Michigan Dance
Marathon.
There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 12:15 p.m. The
next meeting is scheduled for March 17, 2006.

Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order.
Michigan Radio. President Coleman commented that the developments
surrounding the University's radio station are of utmost importance, and made the
following statement-:
"The University and Michigan Public Media share a deep commitment to
education and the public good. It is the bedrockq ofourprogramnmning. In particular, -we
are proud of Mlichigan Radio's award-winning contributions to informing and
educating listeners throughout our state.  The recently discovered problems wvith
financial controls are completely unacceptable and stand in sharp contrast to the core
values of the University of Mifchiganl. University leaders acted immediately upon
discovering this information and a thorough audit has been conducted to identij ý and
correct all the problems. I wvant to assure our supporters that we will take every
possible step to insure that this will not happen again. Public radio eifoys a special
trust with its listeners and I am committed to maintaining tatbod wh  sup
of-IMichigan Radio."
University Faculty and Sabbaticals. President Coleman noted that the issue of
faculty sabbaticals had recently made headlines in local newspapers, and that the
University needs to provide better explanations of the purpose of sabbaticals to the
public. She stated that sabbaticals are absolutely essential to scholarship, noting that
"knowledge does not progress without research, and a sabbatical leave makes possible
intensive research and creativity."  Sabbaticals allow faculty uninterrupted time for
exhaustive work, which is not possible to do while teaching, conducting on-campus
research, and engaging in public service. She gave an example of advances that have
been made in AJDS education in Africa and through religious entities by a University
faculty member during her sabbatical leave. This experience, which will enhance the
knowledge she can impart as a teacher and researcher, will benefit students and society

orchestra. Regent McGowan agreed that this is an astonishing accomplishment forthis
young woman.
President Coleman also commented on the University's recently announced
initiative to expand its outreach efforts to community college transfer students from low
and moderate income families.
Regent Deitch thanked President Coleman for her leadership in moving forward on
the Michigan Radio matter, and alsocommended the effrts by the Regents' Finance,
Audit and Investment Committee, chaired by Regent Bradon and including Regents
White and McGowan. The committee's work has been very important in ensuring public
trust in the Regents' goveance of the University.
Presentation: Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy
President Coleman introduced Rebecca Blank, dean of the Gerald R. Ford School
of Public Policy.
Dean Blank noted that the mission of the school is to prepare students for
leadership in areas of public affairs and public policy and to do research on topics that
illuminate issues of public policy and public policy analysis. She gave a brief history of
the school and noted that it is consistently ranked among the top five in the nation. She
descibed the school's curriculum and the careers itsgraduates pursue, as well as the
demographics and backgrounds of its students.
Dean Blank pointed out the school's traditional strengths in economic and
quantitative analysis of policy and social policy as well as more recent areas of
international policy and science policy. She noted that a joint, interdisciplinary Ph.D.
program was started in 2000 and it receives more than 120 applications for 6-8 available
slots each year. The school's newest program is an undergraduate policy studies degree,
with an initial size of 100 stdents.
Dean Blank discussed the school's faculty, which consists of regular academic
faculty as well as practitioners in the non-academic arena. She also noted that the
school has three major research centers. With respect to the budget, DeanBlank
reported that theschool has enjoyed recent substantial growth in tuition revenues, direct
and indirect researh funding, and gift and endowment income. Recruiting and
retaining faculty are the biggest challenges she faces as a dean. Finally, she noted that
the school will be moving into its own new building, Joan and Sanford Weill Hall, in
August 2006. She said that she does not anticipate the school aiming to greatly increase
its size after moving into the new facility.
A discussion followed during which Dean Blank responded to comments and
questionsfrom the Regents. Vice President May commented hat under Dean Blank's
leadership, fundraising in the school has grown dramatically, and the school was the
first to have met its Michigan Difference campaign goal. It was noted that the new
building is to be dedicated October 13, 2006, and that former president Gerald R. Ford
and his family expect to be in attendance.

March Meeting, 2006

Presentation: Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ("LEED")
Associate Vice President Hank Baier gave a presentation describing the Leadership
in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Program, which is a program created by
the U.S. Green Building Council that promotes environmentally-responsible and
sustainable buildings. The program sets environmental standards for site development,
water and energy efficiencies, materialsand resources, and indoor environmental air
quality. Henoted that the LEED progam involves a score card system in which 69
points is the highest possible number of points. There are four levels of certification:
"Cetified" (26-32 points); "Silver" (33-38 points); "Gold" (39-51 points); and
"Platinum" (52 or more points).
Mr. Baier commented that the School of Natural Resources and Environment's
Dana Building had achieved the Gold level ofLEED certification, and that two current
projects, the Stephen R. Ross School of Business facility and C.S. Mott Children's and
Women's Hospital projects, are currently going through the certification process. He
said that all major University projects use the LEED score card as a type of internal
guideline, but the University does not seek certification formost projects.
Mr. Baer said that there are six LEED scoring categories: "Sustainable Sites" (14
possible points); "Water Efficiency" (5 possible points); "Energy and Atmosphere" (17
possible  points); "Materials  and  Resources"  (13  possible  points); "Indoor
Environmental Quality (15 possible points); and "Innovation and Design Process" (5
possible points), and described the requireents within each scoring category ad how
the University approaches each of these requirements.  He pointed out that the
University meets many of the requirements within a nuberof the categories as a
matter of course, but in some cases the requirements are either not appropriate or not
cost-effective or are otherwise impractical for theparticular building or site.
Mr. Baier comented that the LEED point system changes over time, in some
areas recognizing steps that the University already has taken, such as regionalstorm
water planning, as being wothy of garnering points. He also pointed out that the
University works with manufacturers of such environmentally friendly items as
waterless urinals in order to improve their efficacy and cost efficiency.
Mr. Baier noted that most University projects achieve about 20-28 points, so many
could be LEED certified if the University chose to pursue certification. He described
the University's priorities, which consist of life cycle versus construction costs, energy
savings, cost-effective  environmental performance, durability, competition  in
procurement to control costs, cost control versus cost to recycle construction materials,
occupant preferences versus imposed criteria, a priority on aesthetic reativity and
public spaces, and schedule versus time for commissioning.
Mr. Baier said that the University estimates that LEED certification increases
project costs by 1-10% depending on the complexity of the project and certification
level, and that the University is continuously monitoring the LEED program to note how
its irquirements change. It is also re-evaluating design guidelines, particularly in the
area of energy efficiency. He said that a number of efforts are underway to achieve
energy reduction in existing buildings, pointing out that the environmental impact and
cost savings of reducing energy consumption would dwarf any incremental increase that
could be achieved through the LEED certification process.

March Meeting, 2006

Executive Vice President Kelch thanked Mr. Baier and his staff for educating him
and his staff on these issues, and said he was pleased that the C.S. MottChildren's and
Women's Hospital Project would be seeking LEED certification.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee.           Regent Brandon reviewed the
topics the committee had covered durng its meeting the day before, noting that Regents
White and McGowan also serve onthat committee. The committee first reviewed the
A-133 external audit with University and HealthSyste        officials and representatives
from the University's external auditors, Pricewaterhouse Coopers. Glowing feedback
was received from    the independent auditors regarding the University's perfomnce
against industrybenchmarks.
The committee also reviewed the University's gap analysis and implementation
relative to Sarbanes-Oxley "best practices." This project is being led by Associate Vice
President Peggy Norgren with assistce from         Controller Cheryl Soperand Carol
Senneff, executive directorof University audits. The committeeheld a preliminary
discussion about the contract and fees for conducting the next external financial
statement audit, and it received a regular bimonthly internal audit report from Ms.
Senneff. A follow-up discussion was also held with Provost Ned Gramlich regarding
management of the endowment distributions over tine.
Regent Brandon reported that the committee had also met with Ms. Senneff and
Ms. Jeanette Baltimore, a University Audits staff member who is leading the audit
investigation of Michigan Radio. He said that the committee and the Board have been
very responsive to this issue, and made the following comments:
The Finance, Audit and Investment Committee is called the "Audit Committee"
for a reason. We ae engaged and very very interested in making sure the financial
controls and reporting that we have at the University are the best that they can be. One
ofthe things we looked for when this was first brought to our attention earlier this year
is the "tone at the top," which means, how does senior management react when a
problem is identified. I'm pleased to report that our senior management team was
cooperative, engaged, responsive, and was completely transparent in the way that they
approached the investigation of this issue and identifing exactly what happened. Most
importantly, they put a plan together to react to that and get this on a diferent
trajectory.
So the committee has been engaged with the president, with Carol, and with
Jeanette and all of the diferent areas of the University, including DPS  I can assure
you we are taking steps and implementing measures to make sure that the integrity of
the financial controls and adherence to policies at Michigan Media and throughout the
University are the best that they can be. In the earlier stages we called this "Phase I."
I think  S is to be complimented and recognized for the work that they did, and also
Internal Audit, including Carol Senneff and Jeanette Baltimore. They focused on the
specific area of wrongdoing, they dealt aggressively with the management failures and
the individuals involved in the unlawfid acts, and I am completely satisfied that we did
everything we could do in responding to that situation.
I also want the community to know that we have engaged in further audit
investigations throughout the entire enterprise of Michigan Media to make sure that we
have identified any weaknesses in controls. We have engaged the assistance of our
independent auditors to make sure that sufficient resources are available. We've

controls needed to have the assurance and trust that adequate financial systems and

March Meeting, 2006

Science, and the Arts, and professor of atmospheric, oceanic  d space sciences,
College of Engineering. Professor Sacks died on February 11, 2006, after a courageous
battle with cancer. He was 63.
Professor Sacks received his B.S. degree from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign in 1965 and his Ph.D. deree in analytical chemistry from the
University of Wisconsin in 1969. He began his career as an assistant professor in
Arbor that sae year and was promoted to associate professor in 1974 ad professor in
1979. He served the chemistry department as associate chair for graduate studies from
1987-1992.
During his 37 years in the chemistry department, Professor Sacks was a truly
outstanding educator. He taught both undergraduate and graduate students the principles
of modem analytical chemistry and instrumentaion, and he was a drivingforce in
modernizing the analical chemistry curriculum. He developed completelynew courses
on chemical instrumentationat the undergaduate level and, at the graduate level, he
introduced courseson lectronic measurements and microcomputer control of analytical
instruments,as well as modem separations methods. He served as mentor to more than
35 Ph.D. students who have gone on to distinguished careers in academia, industry, and
government laboratories.
Professor Sacks was internationally recognized for his pioneering work on
analytical instrumentation. During the early part of his career, his research focused on
novel atomic emission spectroscopic methods, including direct solid-sample elemental
analysis. In the 1970s, he developed exploding thin film platforms for solids analysis
that combined simplicity of sample introduction with unprecedented low detection
limits. In the mid-1980s, he turned his attention to innovative approaches to high-speed
gas chromatographic separations of complex mixtures of volatile organic compounds.
His methodologies reduced measement times for complex mixures almost 100-fold
and attracted geat academic ad industrial inteest.his wor eventually led Professor
Sacks and several of his students to form a spin-off company, Chromatofast, Inc., that
commercialized instrumentation invented in Sacks' laboratory. In recent yearshe helped
lead efforts at the University to create wireless micro-analytical systems for
environmental, homeland security, and deep-space applications. During his career,
Professor Sacks and his coworkers published more than 150 research papers on these
topics and presented their findings at scientific conferences all over the world.
As we mourn the loss of our beloved colleague, we aso extend our heartfelt
condolences to his wife,    and his daughter, Jenny.

APRIL MEETING, 2006

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
April 21, 2006
The Regents convened at 9:15 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Taylor, and White. Also present
were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President Forrest, Interim Provost
Gramlich, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President
Krislov, Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President
Rudgers, Executive Vice President Slottow, and Vice President Wilbanks. Regent
Brandon was absent; Regents Deitch and Richner participated via telephone.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She announced that the 75th
anniversary program of the Hopwood Awards would be taking place that afternoon,
noting that this is one of the country's most well-known awards for writing, with more
than 3,000 awards having been presented since the founding of the program.
President Coleman also commented that commencement would take place on
April 29, and that journalist Christiane Amanpour would be receiving an honorary
degree and addressing the graduates.
Presentation: Stephen M. Ross School of Business
President Coleman introduced Robert Dolan, dean of the Stephen M. Ross School
of Business.
Dean Dolan gave a presentation describing how the Ross School is positioned
among the other top business schools and the strategy the school has adopted to
differentiate itself from the other schools. It is the only school among the top twelve that
offers full-time, part-time, and executive MBA programs, along with a BBA program
and an executive education program.  The school has developed a program of
"broad-based intellectual capital with impact" (a large research operation), and has
incorporated this research into the classroom by curriculum innovation and by
capitalizing  on  "co-creation  opportunities."  The  latter  includes  offering
cross-disciplinary programs in cooperation with other schools and colleges at the
University and allowing students to customize their program according to their
individual needs, referred to as "action-based learning."
Dean Dolan reported that the Ross School consistently ranks highly in research
performance. He described two things that differentiate the school from others. One is
the Michigan Leadership Program, which engages students before they start classes and
helps them develop a customized, individual pathway that will help them acquire the
leadership abilities they are seeking. Second, all first year MBA students are involved
in Multidisciplinary Action Projects ("MAP"), which are 8-week projects involving
companies all over the world. Thus, leadership capabilities are developed in three
ways: through the MAP projects, through elective courses, and through non-credit

283



April Meeting, 2006

activities. MAP and action-based learning also allow students to develop the full range
of managerial skills in a way that is not possible using the typical case-study model. He
explained that currently, students are involved with 85 projects, 59% of which are
international.  These include corporate and entrepreneurial venues, as well as
non-profits, including an innovative project involving the Clinton HIV/AIDS
Foundation in Rwanda.
In addition to action-based learning projects which send students out into the "real
world," the school also creates the real world on campus, through such entities as the
Tozzi Electronic Business and Finance Center. Dean Dolan noted that the Ross
School's emphasis on action-based learning and practical experience led to its being
named the top business school by the Wall Street Journal in 2004. He reported that
yield numbers have improved significantly over the past ten years, as has the proportion
of women.
Dean Dolan described some of the features of the BBA program, including the
"Mastery Project" which helps at-risk students improve their competitiveness for
admission to the program. He also discussed some of the programmatic support the
school has received and described some of the challenges created by developing,
recruiting, and retaining faculty. He noted that the school has created programs in such
countries as Korea and India to provide additional opportunities for faculty and
students.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent White reported that the
committee, including herself and Regents Brandon and McGowan, executive Vice
President Slottow, and other staff, had met the day before and considered three topics:
the Athletic Department five-year strategic operating and capital plan; the FY07
General Fund Budget; and an update on the University of Michigan Press.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor reported
that the committee had received an update on current dean searches; a status report on
the LEO unit clarification petition; and briefings by Associate Vice President Laurita
Thomas on HRAA recruitment and retention efforts as well as the HRAA organization
and strategic vision. He noted that the committee will be studying key performance
indicators within HRAA at future sessions.
The Regents then turned to the consent agenda.
Consent Agenda
Minutes. Vice President Churchill submitted for approval the minutes of the
meeting of March 17, 2006.
Reports. Executive Vice President Slottow submitted the Investment Report, the
Plant Extension Report, the Regents' Report on Noncompetitive Purchases over $5,000
from Single Sources, and the Human Resources and Affirmative Action (HRAA)
Report. He reported that three of the child care centers on campus have been
consolidated and are under the administrative supervision of Associate Vice President
Laurita Thomas. The goal of the consolidation is to provide higher quality and
increased infant and toddler child care capacity and improved physical facilities. He

284



April Meeting, 2006

noted that enrollment has been expanded and other improvements have been made as a
result of this consolidation, and that consideration is now being given to renovation of
the facilities.
Litigation Report. Vice President Krislov submitted the Litigation Report.
Research Report. Vice President Forrest submitted the Report of Projects
Established, March 1- 31, 2006.
University of Michigan Health System. Executive Vice President Kelch called
attention to a collaboration between M-Care and the Michigan Healthy Community
through which the Healthwise information service provided to members of M-Care is
now being made available to all University of Michigan faculty and staff.
Division of Student Affairs. Vice President Harper commented about the
exceptional role students play in helping the institution reach its goals. She thanked
Jesse Levine, outgoing president of MSA, for his work during the past year on a variety
of issues. She also acknowledged incoming MSA president Nicole Stallings.
Vice President Harper also called attention to the request for approval of the
2005-06 University Housing Residence Hall and Northwood Community Apartments
rates. The residence hall recommendation is for an average increase of 5.9% for room
and board rates, which includes increases of 1.7% for utility costs; 2.2% for general
expenses, including employee salaries and benefits; and 2% for the Residential Life
Initiative, targeted to residence hall renewal. The recommended rate increase for
Northwood Community Apartments (formerly Family Housing) is 3.5%, targeted at
covering increased utility costs.
University of Michigan-Dearborn. Chancellor Little reported that next month he
will be bringing forward a recommendation for the appointment of Susan Martin as
provost of the Dearborn Campus. She is currently executive associate vice president for
academic affairs at Grand Valley State University.
University of Michigan-Flint. Chancellor Mestas reported that the Flint Campus
commencement exercises will be held May 7. William S. White, chairman and CEO of
the C.S. Mott Foundation and an honorary degree recipient, will be the commencement
speaker.
Michigan Student Assembly Report.      President Coleman thanked MSA
President Jesse Levine for his leadership during the past year. Mr. Levine introduced
incoming president Nicole Stallings. Ms. Stallings outlined her plans for the coming
year. These include strengthening MSA's connection to the student body in order to
strengthen MSA's impact on campus. Other goals include continuing to work on
engaging MSA alumni, and to achieve tangible improvements in campus safety and
security. She noted that plans are being developed to deal with anticipated tensions
next fall with respect to the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative ballot proposal.
Voluntary Support. Vice President May submitted the Report of Voluntary
Support for March 2006. He reported that since the last meeting, the campaign had
reached $2.1 billion toward the $2.5 billion campaign goal. He also reported on
progress in the faculty and staff campaign, noting that an event had been held for the
550 faculty and staff who had each contributed at least $10,000.

Bruce M. Carlson, M.D., Ph.D., professor of anatomy in the Department of Cell
and Developmental Biology in the Medical School and research professor in the
Institute of Gerontology, retired from active faculty status on January 31, 2006,
following 40-year career as an active teacher, researcher, and administrator.
Dr. Carlson received his B.A. degree from Gustavus Adolphus College in 1959,
his M.S. degree from Cornell University in 1961, and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from
the University of Minnesota in 1965. He joined the University of Michigan faculty as an
assistant professor of anatomy in 1966 and was promoted to associate professor in 1970
and professor in 1975. From 1979-2001 he also held an appointment as professor of

296



April Meeting, 2006

biology. He was appointed research scientist in the Institute of Gerontology in 1989
and was promoted to senior research scientist (now research professor) in 1997. He
served as chair of the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology from 1998-2000 and
was director of the Institute of Gerontology from 2000-2003.
A pioneer in the field of mammalian regeneration, Dr. Carlson conducted
extensive laboratory research in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands,
Finland, and New Zealand. He has authored ten books on embryology and regeneration
and two more are nearing completion. He has served as president of the American
Association of Anatomists and president of the Association of Anatomy, Cell Biology,
and Neurobiology Chairpersons. His honors include the AAAS Newcomb-Cleveland
Prize, membership in the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, and the Henry Gray
Award of the American Association of Anatomists. An accomplished teacher, he has
received the Medical School's Elizabeth Crosby and Kaiser-Permanente Teaching
Awards.
The Regents now salute this distinguished faculty member by naming Bruce M.
Carlson professor emeritus of anatomy and research professor emeritus.
Bruce A. Friedman, M.D., professor of pathology, retired from active faculty
status on April 30, 2006.
Dr. Friedman received his M.D. degree from the University of Michigan in
1966. He completed an internship at Yale-New Haven Hospital in 1967, received
residency training in pathology at the University of Michigan from 1967-71, and served
in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1971-73. He joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1973 as an assistant professor of pathology, and was promoted to associate
professor in 1976 and professor in 1980. From 1979-82 he held a joint appointment as
associate professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health. In addition to his
professorial appointments, Dr. Friedman served in a number of administrative
capacities, including assistant (1973-74) and then associate (1974-82) director of the
Blood Bank, director of Phlebotomy and Central Distribution (1980-96), and director of
Pathology Data Systems (since 1982). Within the Health System, he held positions as
director of Ancillary Information (1996-2000) and director of Clinical Support Systems
(2000-01).
Dr. Friedman is the author of more than 80 publications in the area of
information technology and its strategic position in the medical electronic record and
other areas of health care. He coined the term "pathology informatics" in the medical
literature, which has become part of the lexicon. He has been an editorial consultant for
a number of journals, and serves on the editorial board of Clinical Laboratory
Management Review. He has served as a consultant on information technology and
laboratory management and is the founding president of the Association for Pathology
Informatics. From 1983-2003, Dr. Friedman directed an annual symposium held in
Ann Arbor, "Automated Information Management in the Clinical Laboratory"
(AIMCL). Since 2004, he has conducted the LabInfoTech Summit in Las Vegas (a
continuation of the AIMCL), which is one of the two leading international conferences
devoted to information technology in the clinical laboratory. He also created a business
intelligence blog, "Lab Soft News," devoted to the clinical laboratory and pathology
informatics, which is now achieving a global following.
The Regents now salute this distinguished scholar by naming Bruce A.
Friedman professor emeritus of pathology.

Memorials. No deaths of active faculty members were reported to the Regents this
month.
Degrees. Provost Gramlich submitted for approval the doctoral degree list for the
April 2006 commencement, the final degree list for the Law School December 18, 2005
commencement, and changes to previously approved degree lists.
Approval of Consent Agenda. On a motion by Regent McGowan, seconded by
Regent White, the Regents unanimously approved the Consent Agenda.
The Regents then turned to consideration of the regular agenda. Regents Deitch
and Richner joined the meeting by telephone at this point.
Conflict of Interest Items
President Coleman announced that the agenda includes 5 conflict of interest items,
each of which requires 6 votes for approval. On a motion by Regent Maynard,
seconded by Regent White, the Regents unanimously approved each of the following
items:
Amendment to License Agreement among the University of Michigan, Princeton
University, University of Southern California, and Global Photonic Energy
Corporation
The Regents approved an amendment to a license agreement among the University
of Michigan ("University"), Princeton University, University of Southern California,
and Global Photonic Energy Corporation ("GPEC") by which GPEC will add the
University to its existing license with Princeton University and the University of
Southern California. Because Stephen R. Forrest, a University faculty member and
executive officer, is also partial owner of GPEC, this agreement falls under the State of
Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute. The following information is provided in
compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and GPEC.
2.   The amendment terms include adding the University as a party into the existing license
which gives GPEC an exclusive license with the right to grant sublicenses to
technology developed under their research funding. GPEC will pay a royalty on sales
and reimburse patent costs. The University will retain ownership of the licensed
technology and may continue to further develop it and use it internally. No use of
University services or facilities, nor any assignment of University employees, is
obligated or contemplated under the agreement. Standard disclaimers of warrantees
and indemnification apply, and the contract may be amended by consent of the parties.
Additional conflict of interest review will be done as appropriate
3.   The pecuniary interests of Dr. Forrest arise from his ownership interest in GPEC. He
will waive any personal participation in the sharing of revenue received by the
University.
Subcontract Agreement between the University of Michigan and SubLamda
Technologies, Inc.
The Regents approved a subcontract agreement with SubLamda Technologies, Inc.
to perform research at the University under the direction of Dr. Alan J. Hunt. Because
Dr. Hunt is both an owner of Sublamda Technologies and a University of Michigan

298



April Meeting, 2006

employee, this subcontract falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of Interest Statute.
The following information is provided in compliance with statutory requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the University of Michigan and SubLamda Technologies,
Inc.
2.   The terms of the agreement conform to University policy. Dr. Hunt will be the
principal investigator for the project at the University to be conducted over an initial
one-year period at an estimated total cost of $48,838 including indirect cost at 9%, the
rate that is available to all STTR Phase I proposals.
3.   Dr. Hunt's pecuniary interest arises from his ownership of SubLamda Technologies,
Inc. His participation in this project will only be in his capacity as an employee of the
University.
Patent Option     Agreement between       the   University   of Michigan     and   Nico
Technologies Incorporated
The Regents approved a patent option agreement with Nico Technologies
Incorporated ("Nico") for licensing of the following technology from the University:
UM File No. 3339, "Fabrication of Inverted Colloidal Crystal Scaffolds for 3D Cell
Cultures in a Standard Cell Culture Well-Plates and the use thereof in Biological
Assays." Because Professor Nicholas Kotov is both a University of Michigan employee
and a partial owner of Nico, this agreement falls under the State of Michigan Conflict of
Interest Statute. The following information is provided in compliance with statutory
requirements:
1.   Parties to the agreement are the Regents of the University of Michigan and Nico
Technologies, Inc.
2.   Option terms include giving Nico the option to obtain exclusive license in the field of
use of biomaterials with the right to grant sublicenses. The University will retain
ownership of the optioned technology and may continue to further develop it and use
it internally. No use of University services or facilities, nor any assignment of

the Big House and Michigan football.
It is precisely because it is so valued that I feel such a deep responsibility to renew its aging
infrastructure and atted attnd to the 80-year-old stadium 's most pressing needs.
As everyone knows, we have been studying these needs and potential solutions for a long
time now. Bill Martin and his staff in the Athletic Department have completed the most
comprehensive planning process I have ever seen undertaken on a university project. They
explored a wide range of options for how we might approach major renovations. They conducted
detailed cost analyses and financial modeling. They commissioned major surveys of fans and
ticket holders to better understand what people most want in the game-day experience, and in any
renovations we might undertake.
Inrfact, we have talked with the public about potential stadium renovations for more than a
year and a half Bill has gone out to large and small groups across the country to discuss possible
changes and gather input for the planning process. So have L. We appreciate the feedback we
heard and the tremendous sense of ownership felt by Michigan fans.
Through it all, we have been clearly described the challenge: To find the best pathi for
renovating thee stadium whil respecting its history and tradition and in a way that maintains the
long-tei-n financial health of the Universit and the Athletic Department.
So finally, after all those months of consideration, Bill and Tim Slottow are ready to bring
forward a final recommendation for your discussion and vote. I am deeply gratefid for the
mountain of good work that has gone into this process, and I am frlly supportive of this proposal
and its vision for ensuring the unique experience of the Big House.
She noted that an action request on the stadium project had been distributed, and
called on Executive Vice President Slottow. Mr. Slottow introduced Athletic Director
Bill Martin to make a presentation on the program for this project.
Mr. Martin thanked      President Coleman     for her support, engagement, and
challenges during the lengthy process leading up to this presentation. He noted that as a
long-time resident of Ann Arbor, he is passionate about the stadium and said that if the
project is approved, he has all intentions of staying and seeing it through. He
recognized the fact that the stadium renovation issue is a very emotional one, but said he
believes that it is the best long-term solution for the challenges presented by the
stadium.

May Meeting, 2006

Mr. Martin noted that the stadium infrastructure and press box deficiencies have
been studied extensively, as has the potential market for premium seating areas and
potential revenue they could generate. The first of the giding principles that have been
followed throughout the process was that the project positively impact fanexperience
and safety. He noted that it currently takes 36 minutes to empty the stadium, and the
proposed project will be able to reduce this time to 15-20 minutes. Other principles
were that the project be of appropriate quality; be financially feasible (self-financing);
not decrease existing capacity so that it will remain the country's largestfootball
stadium, while at the same time providing wider seats and aisles and handails; and not
limiting future opportunities for additional expansion or other modifications.
Mr. Martin noted that the action request recommends construction of new
structures with club seating and private suites to providerevenues to offset the capital
costs of stadium renovation. He said that the project is financially feasible and
consistent with maintaining the long-term financial health of the University and the
Athletic Department, it will respect the tradition and character of Michigan Stadium,
and will be of appropriate quality.
He described the project as follows:
There would be new structures on both the west side and east side including a new
elevated concourse on the west side and an expanded elevated concourse with new
concessions and restrooms on the east side. On the west side, site of the current press
box, there would be the addition of club chairback seats, a new press box, and private
suites. On the east side, there would be an expanded elevated concourse with new
concessions and restrooms, an outdoor club seating area and a club lounge on one level,
another level with indoor club seats and outdoor club seats, and aother level with
additional private suites.
The stadium would have wider aisles and seats in the seating bowl, and there
would be new free-stading buildings at the north and south ends for new concession
stands and restrooms. Selected restrooms and concession areas would be renovated, and
new ADA seating would be constructed at the top of the west sideline seating bowl on
the new concourse level.
In summary, the new facility would result in improved concourse circulation on the
east and west side and improved bowl circulation and comfort, with wider aisles nd
seats. There will be new concessions, a significant increase in the number of women's
restrooms, and additional men's restrooms. There will be a 78% increase in ADA
seating, a new press box and new hospitality areas, 83 private suites, 2,700 outdoor club
seats and 480 indoor club seats, and 650 chairback seats. Theestimated project cost is
$226 million.
Mr. Martin reviewed the estimated capacity, project costs, and cash flow. He
noted that current capacity is 107,501 and the capacity of the renovated stadium will be
108,251. About 10% of the estimated project cost, $22.6 million, will be funded from
Athletic Department reserves, yielding a project debt of $203.4 million which will be
financed by the University. Mr. Martin emphasized that projected revenue figures are
very conservative and call for an estimated additional gross revenue in year one of
$14.090 million. Combined with the revenue loss from bench seats ($1.290 million)

312



May Meeting, 2006

and the project debt service ($13.230 million), the net  ual cash flow, not including
any major gifts, would be negative $430,000.
He noted that one option considered to fund stadium renovations had been to add a
surcharge to every ticket, but planners decided against this option in the belief that a
clear market exists for premium seating and that revenues from this seating would
negate the need to add additional costs tofans sitting in the traditional seats.
In summary, Mr. Martin said that the project will result in improved circulation
within the stadium, improved ADA capacity without eliminating prime sideline season
ticket locations, the availability of premium seating which will generate new revenue to
offset project costs, and private support opportunities to further offset project costs.
Over time, the project will provide additional revenue streams that will assist with the
capital needs of all of the department's sports. He emphasized that ensuring the highest
level of facilities and opportuities for all 25 sports teams at the University is one of his
major responsibilities, and he believes that this project will contribute to that goal. He
acnowledede the emotions attached to thestadium renovation issue, but said that he is
committed to it's success.  He commented how much he appreciates President
Coleman's supportand requested the support of the Regents.
Executive Vice President Slottow clarified that the request is only for approval of
the project and appointent of the architect, consistent with the normal practice for
projects over $10 million. If approved, the Board would next review and be asked to
approve the schematic design, and then the final project would come to the Board for a
third time prior to being sent out for bids and award of contracts. Mr. Slottow also
noted that Athletic Department staff have worked very closely with staff in his office in
developing this project. Very detailed cost estimates have been done, and he said he is
quite confident in the existing proposal relative to where we norally are at this stage in
a project.
Mr. Slottow also commented that since Mr. Martin has become athletic director,
the Athletic Department has had seven years of positive operating margins, has raised
funds to be able to invest in significant deferred maintenance needs, and has realized his
first priority, construction of the new Academic Center. He commended M. Martin and
Athletic Department staff for having achieved sufficient financial stability to be able to
undertake such a project.
The floor was then opened for discussion.
Regent Richner inquired why the preferred seat donation couldn't be designated
for this project. Mr. Martin responded that the preferred seat donation had been used to
Regent Deitch noted that the action request calls for a budget of $226 million and
last month's estimate had been $227 million. Mr. Slottow responded that the numbers
are not precise to the exact dollar, and that a more detailed reconciliation and estimate
would be submitted with the schematic design. He also noted that the approximate
$500,000 negative impact on the operating budget noted in Mr. Martin's comments is a
vey conservative estimate, and he is comfortable that it can be absorbed within the

313



May Meeting, 2006

depament's operating budget if it remains when the final figures are determined.
Budget estimates will continue to be refined as final project plans are developed.
Regent Deitch noted that positive cash flow figures are based on assumptions that
suites and club seats would all be sold. He asked, "Is there a set of circumstances under
which you would come back and say, 'Regents, these numbers don't work any more?"'
He said he had been told by experts in stadium construction that there can be a swing of
as much as 30% from concept to working drawings. He inquired, "Assuming that the
difference is 10%, and if interest rates increase from 5% to 6% before bonds are sold, is
there a number that is no longer feasible? Or are you saying to us,... this is going to get
done no matter what the cost is?"
Mr. Martin responded, "You never know what's out there."  If there were
exogenous factors such as another 9/11 event or an oil scare which would cause interest
rates to rise, he said, "You bet I would say, whoa. Let's re-examine this. If an event
were to happen that totally thows off the economics of this project," he said, "I'll be the
first one to raise my hand and say, 'Let's sit down and talk about it."'
Regent Deitch commented that if this were a private sector development and the
Regents were the board of directors of a lending institution, they would acknowledge
that it is an interesting project with a well-regarded developer, but would also want to
see pre-leasing and pre-sales figuresbefore making a financial commitment. Heasked,
"Given that this is going to have a lead time, do you intend before you come back to us
for final approval on the financing to have raised some of the projected $25 million and
to have pre-sold some of the suites or leases? Or will marketing not begin until the
entire project is approved?"
Mr. Martin responded that the department has thought it would be inappropriate to
explore leases on suites or premium seating or other such issues prior to approval by the
Regents. He also commented that prices can always be adjusted, and they should be
adjusted to the market. However, it would not be wise to set prices today for a project
coming on line 4-5 years from now, before final costs have been detemined.
Regent Deitch asked when renovation of Crisler Arena would be commenced,
given that the stadium project will not be concluded until 2010. Mr. Martin responded
that like all other projects, renovation of Crisler Arena is driven by having the resources
available to pay for it. At this point in time, no major donor has been identified for
funding of the Crisler Arena project. He noted that Crisler Arena is not considered to be
a property of the Athletic Department, and priority for its use does not reside with the
department. Therefore, thre have been discussions with central administration about
sharing the costs of renovating this facility. Mr. Slottow responded that renovation of
Crisler Arena is a very high priority, and clarified that all facilities on campus are owned
by the University.
Regent Deitch addressed President Coleman about her belief that it would not be
appropiate for beer or wine to be served in the club seats or suites. He noted that to his
knowledge, there are no other club seats or suites in the country where liquor is not
served, and asked how she envisioned this policy being enforced in the future when the
current board and administration are no longer serving. President Coleman responded
that she cannot speak for future presidents and boards, but that she feels very strongly

314



May Meeting, 2006

about the policy and believes that the board supports it. "As long as I am here," she
said, "there will be no alcohol."
Regent Newman commented that this is really a board decision, and if a future
board decides to allow alcohol in these areas, that would be up to them, as are all other
decisions of this nature. Regent Deitch clarified whether, in this initial phase, if it is
discovered that the no-alcohol policy is limiting sales, "then that will be that." President
Coleman concurred.
Regent Brandon moved approval of the Michigan Stadium Renovation and
Expansion   Project as described    in the Regents Communication, and          authorized
commissioning -   NTB Architecture for its design. Regent Taylor seconded the motion.
Regent White made the following motion:
"Madame President, I move to postpone consideration of tlis action until the June 16, 2006
formnal session of the Board of Regents so that the public has an opportunity to be heard on this
matter.
We have put this in the supplemental agenda. The people of the State of Michigan have duly
elected each member of the Board of Regents. In canying out the duties of this office, matters this
board is scheduled to vote on should be adequately noticed to the public. In principle, when a
public institution intends to vote on projects exceeding $200 million, the public has an interest in
knowing the details of this plan with sufficient notice for comment. Such notice given should not
be the minimum required under the la; but should befit the magnitude of the project. Notice gives
the public an opportunity for the people to be heard. Sufficient notice was not given here.
Evidencing this lack of notice is that the stadium project is not part of our regular agenda, which
is posted on the website. Instead, this project is part of the supplemental agenda, which is not
included anywhere on the website. Further evidence of the lack of notice is the fact that there are
no people signed up to talk about the stadium renovation project as Public Conumments today.
From the hundreds, if not thousands, of emails I have received concerning this project, I must
assume that at least one individual would have signed up to address this Board f adequate notice
had been given.
Although I was not on the Board when the Board of Regents approved the "Halo" stadium
renovation, I was a member of the public who did not have an opportunity to see this project
before it was built. If I had been on the Board then, I would have asked for the kind of public
notice that I am asking for today. At least it was economically feasible to take the "Halo" down.
Once hlxuxy boxes are built, it would be prohibitively expensive to undo such construction.
It cannot be that there is a need to  ove so quickly that this vote need not be properly
noticed. In other words, what is the rush? These are renovations to a football stadium, not the
building of a hospital where a month delay could affect people's lives. The stadiim renovation
will not affect football recruiting,; next year's recruiting class has already been picked. Football
games will not be postponed by a month's delay the football field will be unaffected.
We are a public institution, with a governing board elected by the people. It is sound and
prudent judgment to postpone this vote until the June meeting when eveyone wvill be on notice that
such a vote is coming. Ma'be it is because I am a lawyer, but I truly believe that you cannot be
right on substance if you are wrong on process."
Regent Deitch seconded Regent White's motion, stating he wished to associate
himself with her remarks.
Regent Newman commented that supplemental agenda items are often considered
during the normal course of business at formal meetings and continued:

315



May Meeting, 2006

"This has been no secret. This has been out there. We 've had comments at many meetings
and have received hundreds of emails, both for and against. Most importantly, as to the process,
as Tim Slottow raised earlie ths is only the first step. There are two more bifes of the apple, both
much more substantive than this one. I think until we have a project, a design, a scope, of some
sort that we can really look at and that the public really has an opportunity to see what we're all
looking at, on that one, I completely agree with Regent White. That one really needs to be out
there and people ought to see it and have an opporlunity to comment on it, because that's when
we're talking about putting the shovel in the ground. All we"'re looking for here is a concept and a
budget and whether or" not we go forward. I think people have strong opinions and that they
should continue to express them, both for and against, but I will oppose that motion. "
Regent Brandon      and  Regent Taylor announced        that they   would   associate
themselves with Regent Newman's remarks. Regent Deitch commented that "once this
train leaves the station, unless there is another 9/11, the impetus will be to get this thing
done."
Regent Newman responded that we have never cut off public discussion on this
issue.
President Coleman called for a vote on Regent White's motion to postpone
consideration of this issue until the June 16, 2006 meeting. The motion failed, with
Regents Deitch, McGowan, and White in favor and Regents Brandon, Maynard,
Newman, Richner, and Taylor opposed. Discussion then proceeded on the original
motion to approve the project.
Regent McGowan made the following statement:
I am not a sentimentalist; were I, it would have smifaced in scores of votes taken at the Board
table over the thirteen years I have been supporting recommendations for rapid, significant and
often risky change within this University.
I have every regard for this athletic director, for the president and for the views of my
colleagues. Similarly, I respect those who ask only of me that I talk through with them proposals
for change at the University that are on their way thatoware on their ds resolution at this table.
The plan unveiled this morning calls for a massive restructuring of Michigan Stadium at a
very, very high price. But we will be awash in mone from the long-tennrm leasng of 80-odd suites
and 3,300 club seats, our financial team tells us. Their thoroughness and accuracy throughout my
time on this Board has been admirable -- and completely necessary. They'd best be right again.
TWhfen we set about to spend $230 million to build approximately 1,000 suite seats and 3,000 odd
club seats together with what are gracefidly called fan amenities' - more restrooms, more
concession stands, railings - we damn well better be right.
The new structures atop the bowl at the intersection of Main and State Streets in Ann Arbor
will be gargantuan. Absolutely huge. According to the financial modeling we are not being
shown toda  the- will be brimming with people eager and able to pay hundreds upon hundreds of
dollars - or thousands - per game six or seven times during a year.
What we are going to need even more, though, are our fans sitting on those 100,005 plus
bench seats, generations of people who have been with us through thick and thin, who must
contlinue to pay their large seat licenses for their small stake of s  tadium seating in the shadows.
For this plan to be feasible, they must derive satisfaction in doing their part to help finmd all of our
varsity sports teams - as well as fom Michigan football victories. We will need them to be there
cheering their hearts out for Michigan, now more than ever.

316



May Meeting, 2006

I have tried this vote on time and time again over the months leading up to today's public
unveiling and the immediate decision that has been scheduled for today's agenda in Dearborn. I
cannot make that Yes vote fit.
It's too much money spent on too few people; it ' a value I simply do not share. It is being
unveiled to ourpublic and resolved in one breath; that's a value I do not share. I will vote No.
Regent Deitch made the following comments:
"I have been privileged to be a member of the Board of Regents since 1993. 1 was elected
with my colleague, Regent McGowan. In those 13 )/ years iwe have been presented with over 450
proposals to construct new facilities and renovate existing ones. I, like she, have never voted
against one. In fact, a review of the minutes of those meetings establishes that all of those votes
were unanimous. Given that record, it is unassailable that my personal inclination, as well as the
histitutional inclination of the Regents, is to be supportive of the recommendations of the
ahndministration on capital projects.
However, it is also unassailable that the Regents are elected by the people of the State of
Michigan to be good stewards of the University 's assets and culture. Given that responsibility, it
is incumbent on each of us to vote our conscience when we are presented with a proposal which
any of uts in good faith believe to be deleterious for the University. For me, the proposal to
append huge structures to Michigan Stadium in order to house luxury boxes and so-called club
seats is such a proposal. Accordingly, I will vote no and I would urge my colleagues to join me in
such opposition.
I am not voting no because I think the Big House ought to be frozen in amber and remain
forever the same, and everybody who knows me knows that I love change and that I embrace the
future with enthusiasm. Clearly, there is consensus that Michigan Stadium needs updating to
make it an even more wonderfld venue than it is today. Our devoted football fans deserve better
concessions and more rest rooms. We need more space in good locations and better access for the
handicapped. Lord lknows, I need afew more inches in the seat. We need better facilities for the
media and better entertaining areas for the University, since our football Saturdays play such an
important role in institutional advancement.
I have no doubt that the htxLy box proposal is intended to address all these needs. As
presented, it would in fact, at face, do so. I have no doubt that Mr. Martin has brought it forwvard
because he believes it to be the right answer to the stadium needs. He does a fine job as our
athletic director, and simnilar praise should go to Mr: Stevenson and Mr. Winters and Mir. Parker.
Howevet, in my judgment, the plan would address those needs in a way that would 1) aesthetically
ruin our iconic masteipiece stadium; 2) be financially risky; 3) not be respectfidul of our
University 's traditions and culture; 4) contribute to the escalation of the arms race in college
sports, and 5) and 5) prject an insensitivity to the cuent economic condition of our state and the pain
and anxiety of its people. I say that is too high a price to pay, particularly when there is a viable
alternative that will do no harm and will accomplish the needed improveents easilyily while
allowing us to preserve our reserves without risk.
In order for there to be a fidl record of the matter, please bear with me as I offer some
observations on each point:
Aesthetics: Michigan Stadium is the best football stadium in America. It is an architectural
masterpiece. I have been going there regularly and continuously for over 40 years and never fail
to be awed and say "Wow" when I walk in. For me, the genius of the design is the fact that the
stadium is built deep in the ground on a hillside site. Thus, from the outside the stadium is a
proportionate and subtle structture. It is only when one gets inside that one is overwhehned by its
enormity. Hence, the "Big House. "'
The proposed addition is 425,000 square feet, 175,000 square feet in the west side and
250,000 square feet on the east. The west building will be the equivalent of sx stories high and
eight stories high on the east. These are very, very big buildings and their sheer massiveness will,

317



May Meeting, 2006

In my1PIOI opinio, ovet I elm the exvisting structure. For people 1inside the stadium, in the seats, the
sun wvill not shine vey much, lfal all, taking away part of the Joy of jabeautiful, autumn day in
Ann1 _Arbor  4 Also, as Professor Louis Guenin writes in opposing this plan, the stadium's
architectural greatness is based on its "simpicity, understatement, symmetiy, subterraneanity,
smoothness, openness, and vastness." This plan is the anthesis ofall ofthat.
AlsO of greatI sigfc ance is th efCt is that ti e proposed additio nwill1lik elyprove to be a
discordant intrusion in the daily life of the sIurrounding residential neihborhood to the west,
Where the height limitation is 30feet. While the Uni ersity is not bound by city zoning,1Z and could
do anything w ie decide to do on its property,, we, nevertheless, ought to be respectfil of that
physical environment when, as here, it is possible.
Second this proposal is financially risky. Currently, the projected cost isk$226 million (not
$200 million as told to the A" I Arbor News and the Detroit Neiv) with an equit investment of
$22.7 million of theAthletic Department ys approxim ately $27 million of unrestricted reserves. In
the Athletic Department's presentation to us, after meeting the debt service of over $13 million, the
so-called base casefortheproj'ect woulId lose about $485,000 in thefirst year and grow to a net of
$961, 000 in the tenth year, or a positiv7ereturn oo f0.
The department then presents what it calls its "best case" which has the project makig
$4,062,000 in year one, growing to $5,613,000 in year ten. Yet, even this is a return of no more
than 20 on the most optimistic projection, and not remotely close to the projection Of $14.6
million in thefirst- yewrasreported in the Ann ArborNewvs this past Sunday and the Detroit News
today. Failure to hit any one of the assumptionls thalt supportthe bes-%t case w-ill make the return
less than 2%,or 01, w1orse yet, put the project in the red. In order to hit the base case, President
coleman 's administration witill have to thread a needle as a mis-projection on any one of the risk
factor's 1willcreate afinancial drain. Hecre are the challenlges which need to be over1come:
1. No Construction cost Overruns above $226 million or $227 million. I have been
told by stadium construction andfinancexperts that costs can vaiy as much as
30Q'iromconcpt o W01 10~~~PX
30-rmcnett      oking drawings. Thus, a cost increase of 20%, would take
the project to ovier $2 70 Million,
2  No rise in interest rates above the projected 5%. The Dow dropped 214 points On
Wednesday and another 77 points yesterday on fears of inflation. I think interest
rates ar-e likely to go up!
3. All of the box seats and club seats will have to be leased at 5%,1 above the base
budget. I ask: Is this possible in a troubled economy and for spaces where no
liquor will be allowed? MSU has only leased about 300 of 850 club seats.
4. An extra $3.5 million per year must be raised ove - the ten-year period without
hurting other fundraising. I don "t think our generous donors will support this
program nbecause ofa perception tat the project is sebflf-uding or for a lack of
gravitas, I could be wvrong, but that 's' my,,senlse of things.
No business person being prudent would make an investment of this size based only on "best
case" assumptions. Rather; youwould invest on realistic, achievable projections and we have not
been gi'vensuch projections. This proposition is risky to a degree that merts reectiomN. NOne

will not support a change that creates a physical stratification that divides that unique community.
I have read each of the hundreds of heartfelt e-mails that have come into us asking us not to add
hluxy boxes to the Big House, as well as the thoughts expressed in the on-line petition circulated
by SaveTheBigHouse.com. These people are important keepers of this aspect of our University
culture and tradition, and I proudly stand with them. Referring to people'sfeelings on this subject
as "emotional " is a put down and is not right.
The escalation of the college sports arms race. Michigan prides itself on being the "leaders
and best   We have been told that "the" are ae all adding boxes and so we have to add hlwuxr
boxes to be "competitive. " I believe that is patently absurd, and not a sound rationale for such an
undertaking.
Ih my opinion, our true and only peer in college football is Notre Dame. Its stadium was
modeled after the Big House.  hen Notre Dame renovated its stadium, its leaders did not add
htxury boxes. It has no plans to do so, having made a decision to eschew professionalism in the
"House that Rockne Built." We should do the same, and send a message to the Ohio States of the
world that Michigan is dferent, and while we love aand support the maize and blue, our
institutional priorities are projects like Mott Children's Hospital, North Quad, the BSRB, the new
School of Public Health building, the new Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy building, and
the new business school building.
In my opinion, the only thing that matters to our athletes is great facilities. We are told that
by "leveraging" this asset, w  will create more rvenuefor newfacilities. I just don't see how
given the risks. What I see is a mortgaging of our future and a despoiling of our institutional
uniquenessfor the benefit of a ve;, very small group ofpeople.
Insensitivity to current economic conditions. I believe symbolism matters. Very large
institutions best express themselves through their actions - as opposed to their words - and this
action screams of insensitivity to the fact that Michigan is going through a wrenching economic
transfonation. The bottom has not yet hit. I don't know what will happen f GM goes ban7krupt.
Nevertheless, unemployment is 7.2%, while the national average is 4.7%. We have lost 21,000
manufacturing jobs since April, 2005.  Other than the independently wealthy with large,
diversified portfolios of liquid assets, everyone in Michigan is at risk. We will come back as a
state in part because of the work being done at this great university. Let's tell the world that we're
focused on creating knowledge and educating the next generation of leaders and innovators for
our state, and not on things that don't seem necessary in a time when challenge and shared
sacrfice should be what we are about. I simply will not support a project where we are spending
at least $226 million to build private facilities for a privileged few when people in the state are
rightfidly worried about how to keep their homes and pay their children's college costs. I do not
care that this project is supposedly self-funded. Members of the legislature will be hard-pressed to
understand that the University needs a larger appropriation when we do a project like this.
Similarly, how will we look our students and their families in the eye and ask for large tuition
increases when we are doing this project? Instead, we should be following the suggestion of
Regent ewman by building a General Fund endowment to mitigate the need for tuition increases.
We ought to start by going to the people who would pay for these boxes and ask for a contribution
to this fund instead. Colleagues, close your eyes and ask yourselves: Is this the right project at
this time? If you want to do this, why don't we wait until Michigan 's turnaround has been
accomplished?
The Alterative. Originally, we were told that there was no alternative to hlxut, boxes in
order to renovate the stadium. Fortunately, there is an altemnative.
We have been presented withn n alternative plan that the president has not chosen to
recommtend. This plan would add seats (keeping the Big House the biggest), widen the seats and
aisles, put in a new press bo put in new concessions and nlmorae rest rooms. It 's cost is projected
at $56 million. Under this plan, f we put in $5.6 of equiy, we will have a deficit because of debt
service, etc. However, we can get back to break even with a surcharge of $6.00 to $Z 7.00 per ticket
and $3.00 to $3.50 pert student ticket. Those s-urcharges can be lowered if we put in more equity

fiom reseres. For example, f we raise the equity to $11.2 million, the surcharge would be cut in
half to $3.00 to $3.50 and $1.50 to $1.75 per student. I know that we have been told that the
boxes will pay for all stadium renovations without cost to the average season ticket holdem; and I
know that we vere told that the surcharges were rejected because we don 't wantto burden the
average fan. But I'll tell you something. Ifind that a little hard to accept because a few years ago
we put in a seat license of $1,000 per ticket, which caused many of our dedicated lovers of
Michigan football to say, "I can't afford this. " So $1,000 was OK? It's worked success ly, it's
helped stabilize the department's finances. But $3.00, $4.00, $6.00 so that the cost offixing
Michigan Stadium and making it modern would be spread among all of us, that suddenly is too
much and we need the revenue firomn these boxes to allow owrselve to have wider aisles, wider
seats, more johns, and more concessions. For miie, like Regent McGowan, thatjust doesn'tfit into
my value system.
I also have hadfinancial models run. And I have to say in making this point that under Ml:
Martin's leadership, the Athletic Depa tnent has been well run and in fact, about a $27 million
reserve has been created in 6 years. That money has been invested wisely, under Mr. Slottow's
guidance, and I have done a projection that said, "If we just keep doing what we 're doing, do this
project, invest the moncy, get the 8% return that we strive forj in ten years we'd have about $100
milln in cash. I say, that would be enough to do eve thig, including getting Crisler Arena off
the gvound, not maiaana, but now. Because it needs to befixed now.
So in conclusion, for all of those reasons, I vote No. As has been said, there will need to be
two more votes before construction starts-to approve the design (which we haven't seen) and to
approve the budget. Therefore, f this passes, I would tge those ofyou who will vote yes to keep
an open mind about later voting no if you come to agree that the design is bad or the price too
high. And finally, if at the end, the project goes forward, I hope that all of my observations will
have been proven untrue and the project is the success that its proponents believe it will be. But I
cannot in good conscience, for the reasons stated, vote yes, now or in the future.
Regent Richner made the following observations:
Over the past several months, I have heard much about the traditions of the University of
Michigan. But to me, one of the traditions of primaty importance is out tradition of excellence. In
everything we do, the University strives to be the leaders and best. Throughout this process I have
considered the views and concerns ranging from those who have had no contact with the
University other than visiting our stadium on a Satu-day afternoon in the fall, to past presidents. I
have also considered the views of our athletic director, Bill Martin, and his experts and
consultants, and of our chief financial office;, Timn Slottow, and his staff all of whom have spent
months and months studying and analyzing every nuance of this and evemy other reasonable
alternative.
After due consideration of all this infornation, I am convinced that this is the responsible
and prudent course for us to take. As has been described, we had significant safety and access
issues and concerns for the accommodation of those with disabilities that we must address. We
also have a problem with rest rooms, dating back to the opening of the stadium 80 yeats ago. In
the book, The Big House, by Robert Soderstrom, which details the legacy of Michigan Stadium
and its creator, Fielding Yost, the author talks about the fact that not all of the 87,00 who
attended the opening game of the stadium were all that enamaored withi the faciliti at the stadimi.
Quoting fom the book, "A second complaint was writteni by a woman, who stated ini no uncertain
terms that the toilet facilities were pitifidly inadequate and great crowds are lined up for an hour
before each game."
This is not a tradition I wish to continue. As brilliant and forward-thinkimg as Fielding H
Yost was, he did not fix this problem. We atre going to fix it. We do niot have the sumiplus funds to
pay for this, and we are not going to put this burden on the backs of the fans in the stands. I am
confdet that the tUniversity can address the aesthetic conces acnd designi improvements b efitting
of the Umiiversity of Michigan 's traditions.

May Meeting, 2006

Regent Deitch cited ANotre Dame, but I cite the Rose Bowvl, which is a stadium not unlike our
ow1--a bowl-shaped stadium.  In my opinon, they did an excellent jobof accommodating
enclosed seating ith the design of that stadium. I be/ieve in our athletic director; our chief
fii nancial Iofficer, and our-president, and agree that the project improves Michiga Stadi n1and(is
hinthe b est Interests of theUnivherity.
Regent Maynard stated:
I have spent a lot of time studying this, and cameI to the decision that I ve come to probably
later than my other coeIagures wvho are supporting it. But I am here to support the president and
the athletic directot and the CFO.. I thil k this is the best way to upgrade the sadium. Three of mny
values are there. One is that the name ofthe stadium is notfior sale. There is to be no advertising'(ýr
w i 7ithin the stadium, and at leastui inder imywatch th ere wtill be no alcoh ol in th eý stadium.  The other
part of it is that t ve have heard, not just d ring the past ionths, but really over the last years,
comments on both sides in terms of how you renovate and upgrade the stadium. My hope is that
those comments will continue. I do read eveiy one and I wvill continue to do that. I am glad that
our Mlichigan family cares about the stadium anid that ev en though we disagree, ive all disagree in
the atmosphere of caring for the Michigan Stadium.
Regent Brandon said:
There are three reasons Ifwill be votinggfor the stadium. Reason nmiber one is that I believe
this is the best decision for our coaches, our athletes, and ourfans. I believe that and I have
rationale to back up that belief The secondreason is th at Ilthink this i t cost prudent financial
scenario. I have looked at a bunch of them and I know a little bit about this topic, and I absolutely
am conv1inced that we can pay for the stadium, that the dc-leveraging that occurs over time will
create cash flow. that it will create maximum fundraising opportunities, and that the athletic
dirco    of teJitture will never be in a position vhere they look back-and say, "Whatwere they
thinking?" when they made the decision to iider-leverage one ofthe most aluable assets that we
have in the Athletic Department to generate iincom e to support our athletics.
The third reason I am votingfor this is that I choose to support our athletic director. I think
he has done a phenomenaljob, which has been highlighted today, so I won't repeat that. But I
havev to tell you, hie has tur-ned the Athletic Departm ent around and put us in a positionwh ere we
have the ability to do some of the things that frankly, people wvho wvere in that position before him
wvere unwvilling to have the courage or the guts to do. Because lie isrnning a $70 million
business and he has to do it on a stand-alone basis. He, has to cone up with his Own revenue
streams. WTe keep raising the priceo qf tuitionw, wich has a dramatic impact on his operational
costs. He's got massive facilities to maniageand he'sgot salary compression taking place in the
salaries of coaches that is unbelievable. And to not let him have the tools that hie sayvs lie needs to
do hisjob wvel, I think is w1*rong.
So I choose to support our athletic director, I choose to support our president, I choose to
suipport our chieffinancial officem; and the vast number of people I have talked to about this. I
also have a personal bias. -Ilisten to coaches. Ifsomeone wants to talk to me about the Michigan
tradition, or about the importance and relevance  f these kinds ofdecisions to the athletic
department and the athletes and the ipact on the tradition, I choose to talk to coaches. Thefact
of the natte is the coaches I've t    ~alket  andtepol who ~ are~ exper~icenced  and credibl in
Regent Taylor associated himself with the comments of Regents Maynard,
Richner a$B~nd   rndnan     continedl:
I believ this- isa thrgt thing to dno. I have rea:all of th emails and av f lis~tened to alo
the phone calls etc, anld I rjusti thi - itste rgi thing~ to do for a whole varieto reaons that
have beneprsedb ml~ny comlle   es. For the sake~ oftie  Iwon't  go into!all ofit

May Meeting, 2006

I believe that when this project is completed, though, we will be able to say to each and eveny
fan at the Big House, "You are going to be better off than you were before." No matter where you
sit, no matter how much money you have, you ill be better off This will be a better stadium, in
evey respect, for everyone. I believe we can do this in keeping with the history and the honor and
the tradition of the Big House.
I would like to close with this. In business, we often talk about the fact that we have a great
project or a great plan. But the question is, can you successfidly execute that plan? Now for some
who might not k-now it, our athletic director, Bill Martin, does not need thejob. He is a highly,
highly successfid developer. He knows this business. He has done a marvelous job in turning the
department around. He has assembled a wonde~fl team. I am absolttely convinced that Bill
Martin and his team can execute on this plan. And wen it is all said and done, I think it will be to
the greater glory ofthe University ofMichigan. Therefore, I will vote yes.
The vote was then taken on the motion to approve the Michigan Stadium
Renovation and Expansion Project and to authorize commissioning HNTB Architecture
for its design, and it was approved, with Regents Brandon, Maynard, Newman, Richner,
and Taylor in favor and Regents Deitch, McGowan, and White opposed.

Retirement Memoirs. Vice President Churchill submitted memoirs for 19 retiring
faculty members, and Provost Gramlich called attention to the retirements of Jaes
Dapogny, Paul Rasmussen, and Nicholas Steneck.
Layman E. Alen, LL.B., professor of law, will retire from active facultystatus on
May 31, 2006, afteran extraordinary career ofteac g, administration, and research.
Professor Allen received his A.B. degee from Princeton University in 1951, his
M.P.A. degree from   Harvard University in 1952, and his LL.B. degree from      Yale
University in 1956. He served on the faculty at Yale Law School from 1958-66 and
joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1966 as an associate professor in the Law
School and senior research scientist in the Mental Health Research Istitute (MHRI).
He was promoted to professor in 1971 and maintained his appointment in the MHRI
until 2001.
Professor Allen is best kown for his work in mathematical logic, instructional
gaming, and atificial intelligence. He is justly credited as one of thepioneers of game
theory, and has focused most especialy on legal alications of formal-aalytical
methods. His early work, at Yale Law School in the 1960s, paved the way for extending
formal decision-making methods to legal rules. More recently, his reseach has focused
on  formal mathemaical approaches to      questions of constitutional andstatutory
interpretaion. Indeed, he has developed an exhaustiveinterpretive model of several
constitutional amendments in the Bill of Rights.    His work appears in numerous
ma tematical journals, and he has served on the editorialboards of Jurimetrics Journal,
the Jounal of Legal Education, and the Journal of Conflict Resolution. In addition to
these scholarly achievements, he is the author of the widely popular book, WFF 'N

medieval intellectual history, he history of science (both medieval and modern), the
development of ethical practice in the health sciences, and the history of the University
of Michigan. In each of these fields he wrote books, articles, and works of synthesis for
the public, and in the pursuit of his research won significant national and international
grants. He developed popular courses in these areas, and the course he taught with his
wife, Dr. Margaret Steneck, on the history of the University, was a significant factor in
the growth of the study of higher education on the Ann Arbor campus. Out of his
course sequence on the history of science grew our substantial program in the history of
the health, engineering, and physical sciences.
Professor Steneck's service extended from directing the college's Medieval and
Renaissance Collegium to developing the University's programs in values and science,

JUNE MEETING, 2006

The University of Michigan
Ann Arbor
June 16, 2006
The Regents convened at 9:20 a.m. in the Regents' Room. Present were President
Coleman and Regents Brandon, Maynard, McGowan, Newman, Richner, Taylor, and
White. Also present were Vice President and Secretary Churchill, Vice President
Forrest, Vice President Harper, Executive Vice President Kelch, Vice President Krislov,
Chancellor Little, Vice President May, Chancellor Mestas, Vice President Rudgers,
Executive Vice President Slottow, Provost Sullivan, and Vice President Wilbanks.
Regent Deitch was absent.
Call to Order
President Coleman called the meeting to order. She welcomed Provost Teresa
Sullivan to her first Regents' Meeting, noting that she was concluding her third week in
the position and has already become highly engaged in University affairs.
President Coleman observed that the nation's new poet laureate, Donald Hall, had
served on the University of Michigan faculty for 18 years, and pointed out that he is the
fourth former Michigan faculty member to have become the poet laureate of the United
States.
President Coleman also announced that a website had been established to provide
information about the recently approved renovations to the Michigan Stadium.
Presentation: School of Social Work
President Coleman introduced Dean Paula Allen-Meares, the Norma Radin
Collegiate Professor of Social Work, noting that for more than a decade, and during her
entire tenure as dean, the School of Social work has been ranked as the number one
school of social work in the nation.
Dean Allen-Meares commented that the University of Michigan School of Social
Work is one of the largest social work schools in the United States. It moved into its
state-of-the-art building in 1998. The school offers masters and joint doctoral programs
and also involves large numbers of undergraduates in its research programs. She
reported that there is a continuing shortage of professionally trained social workers and
a critical need for social work researchers to continue to develop the evidence-based
knowledge of the profession.
Dean Allen-Meares commented that several factors contribute to the distinctive
nature of the University of Michigan School of Social Work: the depth and breadth of
its research programs, which receive funding from a number of federal agencies,
including the National Institutes of Health, and its interdisciplinary collaborations with
life sciences programs, including medicine and psychiatry. She pointed out that the
school has affiliations with more than 24 schools and units within the University. It
offers a number of dual degree programs, including law, public policy, business, public
health, dentistry, and urban and regional planning, as well as partnerships with

359



June Meeting, 2006

numerous organizations within the state and throughout the world. She described the
Sol Drachler Program in Jewish Communal Leadership, noting that it prepares students
for professional leadership positions in the Jewish community and is the only program
of its kind at a public university.
Dean Allen-Meares described the MSW program and the joint doctoral program,
noting that Michigan is the only highly-regarded school of social work to award joint
Ph.D. degrees and is acknowledged as offering one of the finest interdisciplinary
programs in the world. She noted that faculty body includes clusters of experts in
specific areas, and that research is collaborative and cross-disciplinary, involving
partnerships with community and private organizations and with key foundations.
Although external research funding has increased substantially during the past two
decades, the endowments of the second and third highest ranking schools of social work
in the nation far exceed that of the University of Michigan's. The school has thus far
achieved 94% of its $16.5 million goal in the Michigan Difference campaign.
Dean Allen-Meares gave examples of some of the school's current research
projects and reviewed its plans for the future. These include increased global focus and
internationalization, continued presence in the University's Life Sciences Initiative, and
development of interdisciplinary centers of research and training excellence. In keeping
with this, she reported that the school had recently submitted a major proposal to
establish an "Advanced Center for Intervention and Services Research on Poverty, Risk,
and Mental Health" that would focus on mood and anxiety disorders among poor
individuals.
Dean Allen-Meares concluded by listing the school's challenges, which include
recruitment and retention of faculty, space renovation, providing competitive financial
assistance for students, and increasing external funding and endowment.
CESF Report - Ann Arbor Campus
Professor Fred Askari, chair of the Ann Arbor Campus Committee on the
Economic Status of the Faculty (CESF), presented the committee's report. He reported
that the committee's primary goal is transparency in compensation. He said that the
committee's major concerns are the unfunded liability of retiree health care expenses,
the University's decision to no longer fund Medicare B reimbursement for retirees, and
ensuring that health care remain affordable for current and retired employees. He
praised the University's cooperative efforts to improve employee health and thereby
reduce health care costs.
Regarding compensation, he stated that the committee would like it to be more
equitable and transparent, incorporate gender equity, and maintain competitiveness
among all of its academic competitors. Other issues include the "loyalty tax" on the
salaries of long-term employees, development of a tuition scholarship program for
dependents of faculty members, and adoption of compensation guidelines.
CESF Report - Dearborn Campus
Professor Brooks Hull, chair of the Dearborn Campus Committee on the Academic
Status of the Faculty, presented that committee's report. The report focused on two
issues, market equity and salary compression, and concluded that salary compression
experienced by UM-Dearborn faculty is significantly worse than at comparable

360



June Meeting, 2006

universities. To address this disparity, the committee recommends raising the entire
salary distribution of associate professors and of full professors so that their position
relative to comparison universities is the same as that of assistant professors.
Professor Hull also reported that the UM-Dearborn CESF strongly opposes the
University's announced plans to discontinue the Medicare Part B reimbursement
program for retired employees.
CESF Report - Flint Campus
Professor Steve Turner, chair of the Flint Campus Committee on the Economic
Status of the Faculty, presented that committee's report. He stated that the report
focused on salary compression within faculty ranks and UM-Flint faculty salaries
compared   with  salaries  at peer institutions, especially the  University  of
Michigan-Dearborn. He noted that the lack of a salary increase for Flint faculty in
2003-04 led to a worsening of the effects of inflation and compression on UM-Flint
faculty salaries, and of the rankings of UM-Flint faculty salaries relative to those at peer
institutions. He noted that at every professorial level, the compound annual faculty
salary growth rate on the Flint campus has been less than those on the Ann Arbor and
Flint campuses.
Recommendations include annual faculty raises in excess of new hire starting
salaries as well as targeted faculty equity adjustments to address salary compression,
especially at the full professor level. The committee also recommended that the campus
maintain a high percentage of tenure-track faculty.
Benefits Update
President Coleman introduced Associate Vice President Laurita Thomas. Ms.
Thomas reported that benefits strategies include offering quality, affordable programs
that are market-competitive and that support recruitment and retention of faculty and
staff; serving as a responsible fiscal agent and resource steward; enabling informed
decision-making in decisions around plan choices; and levering internal and external
expertise in developing innovative new programs to promote health and a healthy
environment.
She reviewed initiatives and policy decisions that had effected benefits offerings
for calendar year 2006 and noted that during the past year, the University had
implemented an additional tax-deferred retirement vehicle (a 457(b) plan), expanded the
use of technology to improve service and reduce administrative expense, expanded the
use of on-line benefit enrollments, and launched the Michigan Healthy Community
Initiative.  She reported that the University's health rate increase in 2006 was
significantly lower than the national trend. She reviewed enrollment numbers by health
plan, noting that the M-Care HMO and PPO plans account for the highest percentages
of enrollment among employees at the expense of the Blue Cross/Blue Shield
traditional plans.
Ms. Thomas discussed measures that the University had undertaken with respect
to the Medicare Part D subsidy and the Medicare Part B premium reimbursement,
which reduced its post-retirement benefit liability by 11.7% and 13.6%, respectively.
She reviewed retirement savings plan enhancements that had been introduced in 2006
and described changes that have been made in vendor contracts for the prescription drug

361



June Meeting, 2006

plan, the life insurance program, and the flexible spending account program. She also
described recent technology and service enhancements that had been implemented in
2005 and 2006.
Ms. Thomas described the Michigan Healthy Community Initiative (MUCI)
program undertaken during FY 2006, noting that far more employees than expected had
participated in the "Active U" component of the program. She also described plans for
2007, which will include new MUCI projects, continued technology enhancements, a
review of dental and long term disability programs, consideration of additional cost
savings and risk mitigation strategies, and transitioning to GASB 45 accounting rules.
She cautioned that the University's health care rate increases will begin to approach
national rates by 2008, creating pressure on University resources.
Executive Vice President Slottow pointed out that the importance of the work
being done by Associate Vice President Thomas and her staff, along with staff from the
Health System, provost's office, the CESF groups, and others, studying ways to manage
costs without sacrificing quality or choice. If management actions such as these are not
taken, he noted, these costs will continue to escalate and will impact the University's
ability to use its resources towards enhancing its mission.
Committee Reports
Finance, Audit and Investment Committee. Regent Brandon reported on the
three agenda items the committee had considered the previous day. Along with key staff
members from each area, the committee reviewed the proposed FY07 Athletic
Department operating budget and the FY07 Hospitals and Health Centers (HHC) budget.
He reported that the HHC had achieved a 5.5% operating margin, which is significantly
beyond the budget expectation for FY06, and congratulated the team for this result. The
committee had also had a followup session about the Michigan Health Corporation.
Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee. Regent Taylor reported
that the committee's main focus at its meeting had been to meet with the chairs of each
campus's Committee on the Economic Status of the Faculty regarding their annual
reports. The committee had also received a report from Provost Sullivan on the status
of dean searches and reappointments.
Reappointment of the President
Regent Taylor made the following statement:
As chair of the Personnel, Compensation and Governance Committee, I would like to report
to the University community, the general public, and for our Regental records that over the past
several months the Regents have completed an extremely thorough review of President
Coleman 's performance since assuming office in 2002. We, the Regents, have had numerous and

June Meeting, 2006

She has led the University of Michigan through a very turbulent period of deep budget cuts,
disruptive transition in the region's traditional economic base, and increased demands on
University services. At the same time, she has enhanced the University's financial stability, its
affordability for low-income families, and its overall academic stature. She has achieved these
things in a number of ways. For example, she has assembled, as we just heard in the prior
committee report, a highly effective senior leadership team. She has overseen the spectacular
success of the Michigan Difference fundraising campaign through her personal involvement and
relationship-building with alumni and major donors. We have now exceeded $2 billion in this
campaign, ahead of schedule. She led the affirmative action cases before the Supreme Court,
and managed their aftermath with the goal of enhancing our stature and reputation for valuing
all people.
We had a very unfortunate situation with NCAA basketball sanctions. She led the
resolution of that in a highly successful manner. The University's global influence has been
enhanced by her building of institutional partnerships with China. She introduced the M-Pact
program of extra grant aid to thousands of students each year. She has provided outstanding
leadership in building the physical campus of this university for the 21st century. She has
maintained and enhanced the University's academic strength and reputation through the state's
budget crisis, including the loss of $50 million in state support to the University's General Fund.
She has done that by leading her team to more effective business operations, cost-cutting, and
lower health care costs.
Since President Coleman took office in 2002, enrollment is up and total research
expenditures have grown from $655 million in 2002 to $753 million 2005. Annual private giving
is up by over $100 million. From 2002-2005, cumulative private giving has reached $652
million and the endowment is up from $3.4 billion to $4.9 billion.
Finally, when a president recruits executive officers and world class scholars, which is an
ongoing process at a university like Michigan, a key ingredient to the success is the perception of
a stable leadership. It is analogous to the sports culture of recruiting class athletes. They will
not commit if the tenure of the leadership is in doubt. Being president of this great University is
a complex and difficult undertaking, and we have been fortunate to have Mary Sue Coleman.
Based on the forgoing, I move that President Mary Sue Coleman by appointed for a second
five-year term, commencing in August of 2007, based on the term sheet which is before you, and
by reference to this term sheet, I request that it be made part of our record today. [See
Appendix].  This term sheet in essence gives Mary Sue Coleman the same benefits and
responsibilities as the first contract, with one notable difference and one technical change due to
IRS rules and regulations. The difference of note is that the first contract has a $500,000
retention bonus which is payable after the completion of five full years on the job. She will, of
course, have to serve the remaining year of her current term, which begins in fall 2006, to
receive that. But you also know that Mary Sue and Ken have given that amount of money to the
University as a gift. The second contract contains an annual retention bonus of $100,000 for
each year completed. But in this contract, the $100,000 will vest every year instead of vesting at
the end of five years. Under the second five-year contract, her base salary will be whatever her
base salary is at the end of the first five-year contract.
The technical change is minor, and is related to IRS rules increasing the base for matching
with respect to savings.
Regent Newman seconded the motion, and thanked Regent Taylor for all of his
hard work on this process during the year. She noted that Regent Taylor had led the
evaluation process, using the invaluable experience of his background in human
resources, and that the Regents are indebted to him for this work. She associated
herself with Regent Taylor's remarks regarding President Coleman.

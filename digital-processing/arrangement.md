Description and Arrangement to ArchivesSpace
============================================

The Society of American Archivists (SAA) offers the following definition of [archival description](http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archival-description). 

> The process of analyzing, organizing and recordijng details about the formal elements of a record or collections of records, such as creator, title, dates and contents, to facilitate the work's identification, management and understanding.

The SAA also offers this definition of [arrangement](http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/arrangement):

> The process of organizing materials with respect to their provenance and orgiinal order, to protect their context and to achieve physical or intellectual control. 
>
> The organization and sequence of items within a collection.

Both of these are fundamental archival principles. The Bentley Historical Library makes use of ArchivesSpace, an open source archives information management application, to create and manage **Resources**, whcih allow an archivist to record information about the intellectual and physcial characteristics of archival materials, as well as contextual information about creators and topics. The **ArchivesSpace** pane in the **Appraisal** tab in Archivematica pull data from **Resources** in our instance of ArchivesSpace in order to facilitae archival description and arrangement for digital content.

This procedure provides you with an opportunity to gain full intellectual control of the content so that it can be meaningfully described in an ArchivesSpace **Resource** and packaged in a manner that will facilitate its long-term preservation, management and access. Take time to review files during appraisal! Familiarity with the content is essential for the production of rich metadata and informative **Resources**; it is therefore recommended that you:

  * take notes or create tags during appraisal to help with separations and gaining intellectual control over content; and
  * establish the intellectual arrangement and hierarchy of materials by drafting a **Resource** before packaging files for storage in the repository.
  
While digital processing should be done as efficiently as possible, it is very important that you do not rush through this step. If your collection lacks an appropriate level of description, researchers may not be able to discover valuable information therein. As always, you may quit this procedure at any time and return to complete it at a later date.

# digital-processing

Other things to check out:
  * Process for DVDs (and possibly other digitized comment).

Potential bugs:
  * Searching with spaces doesn't work. That would be nice. (Searching with underscores does work.)
  * Having tag in Examine Contents pane appear next to file would be nice (currently only seems to work in Backlog).
  * Remove tag in file list doesn't work. Also, what is the separate remove tag column?
  * Do we really need Add checked files to file list in examine contents?

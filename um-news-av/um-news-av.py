Here's the draft of the FA attached as well as the original metadata spreadsheets I gave Rob. The series that need to be addressed are:

  * Sound Materials - Audio Reel-to-Reel News Briefs (1975-1994)
  * Audio Podcasts (2006 - 2010)
  * Digital Video

For the podcasts and video, we want to keep:

  * Unit title
  * Unit date
  * Note field
  * Physical facet--file extension(s)

Let me know if you have any questions--thanks!

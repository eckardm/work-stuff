	<b>History:</b><br />
	<i>Esquire</i> was founded in 1933 by David A. Smart and William H. Weintraub, publishers, and Arnold Gingrich, editor. Advertised as a magazine for men, <i>Esquire</i> published fiction, travel, and fashion news for an affluent audience. The magazine was immediately successful, and Esquire, Inc. expanded into other areas, including publication of <i>Coronet</i> beginning in 1936. Gingrich attracted many of the most prominent authors in America to <i>Esquire</i>, from Hemingway and Fitzgerald in the 1930s to Styron and Mailer in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>By the 1960s the magazine had become less fiction-oriented, and published more investigative reporting by such writers as Tom Wolfe and Philip Nobile. In 1977, after Gingrich's death, Esquire, Inc. sold the magazine, and the editorial files were donated to the Michigan Historical Collections.</p>

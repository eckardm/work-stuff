	<b>Biography:</b><br />
	Frederick E. Moncrieff was born in Detroit, Michigan, on September 25, 1922, the first child of Frederick Edwin and Kathleen Garnet Moncrieff. After graduating from Southeastern High School in Detroit, he went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Wayne State University in 1945. Moncrieff worked briefly as a correspondent for the Associated Press in Lansing, Ann Arbor, and Detroit before being hired by the University of Michigan News and Information Services in March 1946, as a photographer. In one of his letters, he mentioned that, "The University purchased my camera and film and even paid me to have the time of my life." Moncrieff added reporter and editor to his responsibilities during his initial ten year stint with the University of Michigan News and Information Services. Among the distinguishing aspects of this period of his career was the organization of the 1955 press conference when Thomas Francis announced that the Salk polio vaccine was safe and effective. He also assisted with the hosting of visiting dignitaries and was the photographer of a famous photograph, taken early in his career, of the University's Diag with students walking amid streaming rays of the sun.</p>
      <p>From 1956 to 1958, Moncrieff worked with his mother as a partner and administrator for Cadillac Nursing Homes, Inc., in Detroit, before returning for another eight years with the University of Michigan News and Information Services. After a period as editor of science and engineering news, he was appointed picture editor of the News and Information Services in 1959. Moncrieff was later named coordinator of radio and television news and then, in 1964, became manager of News and Information Services. Among the highlights of this period was his designation as business manager for the University of Michigan Symphony Band tour of Eastern Europe and the Near East from February to June 1961. Aside from handling all of the business affairs for this tour, he also was the press representative and took more than 1000 photos and captured more than 5000 feet of motion picture film during the tour. The UM Band Alumni Organization named Moncrieff as an Honorary Band Alumni in 1964 for the "many ways he has utilized his talents for the service and betterment of the University bands." Moncrieff accepted the position of director of public information at Cleveland State University in 1966, but returned to Ann Arbor three years later to become manager of communication services and educational development at the Commission on Professional and Hospital Activities. He later worked as a realtor and for the advancement department at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital. Moncrieff died March 6, 2008.</p>

      <p>In 1941 Wallace was hired by the <i>Chicago Sun</i>'s radio station as a newscaster, but soon wartime service as a naval communications officer interrupted his career.

At CBS Wallace was political correspondent and a floor reporter at the Democratic and Republican conventions in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
      <p>In 1968 CBS News executive producer Don Hewitt, with co-editors Mike Wallace and Harry Reasoner, launched <i>60 Minutes.</i> Premiering on September 24, the program was a weekly newsmagazine that revolutionized television news programming. In at the beginning, Wallace continued to work on the program until his retirement in 2006.</p>

	<b>History / Biography:</b><br />
	<i>Historica Critica</i> is a group of active and retired University of Michigan faculty and alumni who believe that the history of the university should be more fully studied, recorded, and celebrated. Toward these ends, <i>Historica Critica</i> has compiled video- and audiotapes of interviews with significant figures of the university faculty, administration, and alumni. The ultimate goal of <i>Historica Critica</i> is to bring about a comprehensive and scholarly history of the university through the use of these tapes.</p>
      <p>Members of <i>Historica Critica</i> who have worked on the interview project include: Claude Eggertsen, School of Education; Allen Britton, School of Music Dean; Robert Iglehart, School of Art; Ralph Loomis, English Humanities; Allan Jones, Prakken Publications; Warner Rice, English; Arnold Kuethe, Aerospace Engineering; Arthur Gallagher, former editor of the Ann Arbor News.</p>
      <p><i>Historica Critica</i> has its own criteria for judging whether a member of the university community merits inclusion in its field of significant figures. These criteria, while undefined, seem to cast a net which primarily includes high-level university administrators, Regents, and emeritus faculty. Presidents Fleming and Hatcher; Vice-Presidents Smith, Niehuss, and Pierpont; Regents Roach and Power; and Emeritus faculty Ackley, William Bishop, Britton, Dow, Kuethe, Maurer, Rucknagel, Sears, and Wegman are among those interviewed. Men prominent on the local Ann Arbor scene are also included: Arthur Gallagher, editor of the Ann Arbor News; George Sallade, Ann Arbor Democrat; and Albert Wheeler, former mayor of Ann Arbor.</p>

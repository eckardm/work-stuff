	<b>History:</b><br />
	The Fellowship of Reconciliation is a religious pacifist organization which was founded in England and soon spread to the United States. The Michigan branch was organized at a convention in Detroit on April 15, 1940. This organization remained active in its opposition to wars and militarism at least until the late 1960's when its newsletter stopped appearing.</p>
